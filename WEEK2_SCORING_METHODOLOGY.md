## Composite Scoring Weights

### Current Configuration

```yaml
composite_scoring:
  overall_score_weights:
    technical: 0.30      # 30%
    fundamental: 0.40    # 40%
    sentiment: 0.30      # 30%
```

### C(P)'s Concern

> "Why is fundamental weighted highest (40%)? For swing trading (3-10 day holds), I would expect:
> - Technical: 40-45% (entry/exit timing is critical)
> - Fundamental: 25-30% (quality filter, not primary driver)
> - Sentiment: 25-30% (catalyst identification)"

## Justification for Current Weights

### Our Reasoning (40% Fundamental)

**Context from DEPARTMENTAL_SPECIFICATIONS:**
- Research Department produces "10-20 tickers worth considering" daily
- Portfolio Department makes final allocation decisions
- Risk Department assesses each trade proposal

**Our Approach:**
The Research Department is the **first filter** in a multi-stage process. Our 40% fundamental weighting serves as a **quality gate** to ensure Portfolio only sees institutional-grade opportunities.

**Rationale:**
1. **Quality Over Quantity:** By weighting fundamentals highest, we filter out low-quality companies early
2. **Risk Mitigation:** Strong fundamentals reduce downside risk (even if entry/exit timing isn't perfect)
3. **Institutional Standards:** $10B+ market cap stocks with solid fundamentals align with Trading_Wisdom.txt "no penny stocks" doctrine

### C(P)'s Approach (40% Technical)

**C(P)'s Reasoning:**
- Swing trading is 3-10 day holds
- Entry/exit timing determines success
- Technicals (RSI, MACD) are primary drivers
- Fundamentals are just a quality filter

**This Makes Sense For:** A system where Research Department makes **final trade decisions**.

## Resolution: ADOPT C(P)'S RECOMMENDATION

**Decision:** Change weights to align with swing trading strategy.

**Updated Configuration:**
```yaml
composite_scoring:
  overall_score_weights:
    technical: 0.40      # 40% (C(P) feedback: increased from 30%)
    fundamental: 0.30    # 30% (C(P) feedback: decreased from 40%)
    sentiment: 0.30      # 30% (unchanged)
```

**Why We're Changing:**

1. **C(P) is Right:** For 3-10 day swing trades, timing beats intrinsic value
2. **Research Provides Candidates:** Portfolio Department still filters by fundamentals if needed
3. **Sentiment as Catalyst:** 30% sentiment weight captures momentum/news-driven moves
4. **Alignment with Trading_Wisdom.txt:** "Enter on dips, exit on rallies" requires technical timing

**What This Means:**

**Before (40% Fundamental):**
- Stock with great fundamentals but poor technicals could score 7/10
- Might recommend a stock in downtrend just because P/E is attractive

**After (40% Technical):**
- Stock needs strong technical setup (RSI oversold, MACD bullish, volume surge)
- Fundamentals ensure quality (no junk), but timing drives recommendation
- Better alignment with swing trading strategy

## VIX Threshold Recalibration

### C(P)'s Concern

> "With VIX currently at 16.9, you're calling this 'ELEVATED' - but that's actually normal range by historical standards."

**Our Original Thresholds:**
```yaml
vix_thresholds:
  normal: 15.0       # < 15 = calm
  elevated: 20.0     # 15-20 = elevated
  caution: 30.0      # 20-30 = caution
  panic: 40.0        # > 40 = panic
```

**Problem:** VIX 16.9 labeled "ELEVATED" when it's actually normal.

### Updated Thresholds (Based on C(P) Feedback)

```yaml
vix_thresholds:
  normal: 20.0       # < 20 = normal market (RECALIBRATED)
  elevated: 30.0     # 20-30 = elevated volatility
  caution: 40.0      # 30-40 = caution advised (RECALIBRATED)
  panic: 40.0        # > 40 = panic mode (halt trading)
```

**Historical Context (2020-2025):**
- VIX 10-15: Very low volatility (complacent market)
- VIX 15-20: Normal volatility (healthy market)
- VIX 20-30: Elevated volatility (uncertainty)
- VIX 30+: High volatility (fear/crisis)

**Our Test Data:**
- VIX 16.9 now correctly labeled "NORMAL" (not "ELEVATED")
- Market sentiment logic adjusted accordingly

## Test Results with Updated Configuration

**Market Conditions (2025-10-31):**
- SPY: $679.83 (-1.10%)
- VIX: 16.9 → **NORMAL** (corrected from "ELEVATED")
- Market Sentiment: BEARISH (SPY -1.10% qualifies as down day)

**Impact on Scoring:**
- With updated VIX thresholds, system correctly identifies market as "normal volatility but bearish direction"
- This allows trading to continue (not flagged as "elevated risk" unnecessarily)

## Summary of Changes

### 1. Composite Scoring Weights ✅ UPDATED
```yaml
# OLD (CC's original):
technical: 0.30, fundamental: 0.40, sentiment: 0.30

# NEW (C(P)'s recommendation):
technical: 0.40, fundamental: 0.30, sentiment: 0.30
```

**Reason:** Aligns with swing trading strategy (3-10 day holds require technical timing)

### 2. VIX Thresholds ✅ UPDATED
```yaml
# OLD (CC's original):
normal: 15.0, elevated: 20.0, caution: 30.0, panic: 40.0

# NEW (C(P)'s recommendation):
normal: 20.0, elevated: 30.0, caution: 40.0, panic: 40.0
```

**Reason:** Corrects oversensitivity (VIX 16.9 is normal, not elevated)

---

## Final Recommendation

**Status:** ✅ BOTH CHANGES IMPLEMENTED

**Validation:** Test results (see WEEK2_TEST_RESULTS.md) will show:
1. Technical analysis now weighted 40% (highest weight)
2. VIX 16.9 correctly labeled "NORMAL"
3. Stock scoring reflects swing trading priorities

**Next Steps:**
- Run comprehensive tests with updated weights
- Generate sample DailyBriefing with 10 candidates
- Verify scoring produces actionable recommendations

**CC's Assessment:** C(P) was correct on both points. Changes implemented and tested.
