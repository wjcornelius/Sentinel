No sells needed as we have no current positions.\n\nFrom the 50 names, the strongest setups cluster in Financials (IBKR, FITB), Consumer Discretionary (CCL), Tech/Materials (HPQ, GLW), Industrials (CARR, ODFL), and Energy (COP). We avoided sub-55 composites and selected 8 positions to deploy exactly 90% of capital. Each buy will be placed with bracket orders: 8% stop-loss and 16% take-profit from entry, targeting 1\u20135 day swings. If entries gap significantly, we\u2019ll wait for intraday pullbacks to maintain favorable risk/reward.",
