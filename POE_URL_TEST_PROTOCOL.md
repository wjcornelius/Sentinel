## Summary Template

After running all tests, summarize:

**What Works Reliably:**
- [ ] Small markdown files (< 100 lines)
- [ ] Large markdown files (> 500 lines)
- [ ] Python source files
- [ ] Files in subdirectories
- [ ] Files with spaces in names (URL encoded)
- [ ] Sequential URL access (one per message)

**What Doesn't Work:**
- [ ] Multiple URLs in same message
- [ ] Non-existent files
- [ ] Non-main branches
- [ ] Directory URLs
- [ ] Very large files (truncation)

**Observed Limitations:**
- Max file size: _____ lines
- URLs per message: _____ (likely 1)
- Rate limiting: _____ (yes/no)
- Encoding issues: _____ (describe)

**Conclusion:**
_[Your overall assessment of PoE's URL capabilities for the Sentinel workflow]_

---

## Next Steps Based on Results

**If most tests pass:**
‚Üí Current workflow protocol is validated, continue using it

**If multiple URLs work:**
‚Üí Update workflow protocol to allow batch file reviews

**If size limits found:**
‚Üí Split large files or provide line ranges to Claude (PoE)

**If encoding issues:**
‚Üí Avoid special characters in filenames, use URL encoding
