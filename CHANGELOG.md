## [Week 3 - Session 2] - 2025-10-27

### Critical Bug Fixes üêõ

#### Conviction Scoring System (CRITICAL)
Two related bugs completely broke the conviction-weighted allocation system:

1. **Conviction Clamping Bug** - `sentinel/tier3_conviction_analysis.py:444`
   - **Problem**: Tier 3 scores were being clamped to max of 10 instead of 100
   - **Impact**: Lost 90% of scoring granularity needed for position sizing
   - **Fix**: Changed `max(1, min(10, conviction))` ‚Üí `max(1, min(100, conviction))`
   - **Result**: Full 1-100 conviction range now preserved

2. **Conviction Weighting Formula Bug** - `sentinel/order_generator.py:295`
   - **Problem**: Formula divided by 10.0 instead of 100.0 when normalizing scores
   - **Impact**: All scores ‚â•10 were normalized to 1.0, getting identical position sizes
   - **Fix**: Changed `conviction / 10.0` ‚Üí `conviction / 100.0`
   - **Result**: High-conviction trades (95) now get significantly more capital than medium (75) or low (50)

**Combined Impact**: These bugs meant position sizing was essentially random. A 95 conviction score got the same allocation as a 50 conviction score. This completely defeated the purpose of the conviction-weighted system.

### New Features ‚ú®

#### 1. Perplexity AI Real-Time News Integration
**New File**: `sentinel/perplexity_news.py`

Fills a critical gap - GPT-4-Turbo alone cannot access current news and events. Perplexity specializes in real-time web search with citations.

**Key Methods**:
- `gather_ticker_news()`: Fetch recent news for specific stocks
  - Earnings reports, analyst upgrades/downgrades
  - Partnerships, acquisitions, product launches
  - Regulatory issues, lawsuits, leadership changes
  - Returns sentiment analysis and key events

- `gather_market_overview()`: Overall market conditions
  - Bull/bear sentiment, economic data releases
  - Sector rotation, Fed commentary
  - Volatility trends (VIX), major index performance

- `gather_batch_news()`: Efficiently gather news for multiple tickers

**Cost**: ~$0.005 per query (or $20/month unlimited)
**Model**: "sonar" (Perplexity's online search model)
**Testing**: ‚úÖ Successfully validated with NVDA ticker and market overview

---

#### 2. Conviction-Based SELL Execution
**Files Modified**:
- `sentinel/execution_engine.py`: New `submit_conviction_sell()` method
- `database_migrations/004_add_conviction_sells.sql`: New database table

**Critical Gap Filled**: System could only generate BUY signals. Positions could only exit via stop-loss or manual intervention. Now Tier 3 can recommend SELL decisions based on deteriorating fundamentals.

**New Database Table**: `conviction_sells`
- Tracks all conviction-based SELL orders (separate from stop-loss exits)
- Records conviction score (1-100), reasoning, P&L, fill status
- Enables performance analysis: "Do conviction-based exits outperform stops?"

**New Method**: `ExecutionEngine.submit_conviction_sell()`
- Submits market sell order based on Tier 3 recommendation
- Automatically cancels associated stop-loss order (prevents double-exit)
- Records full details in `conviction_sells` table
- Returns order ID and success status

**Integration**: Used in workflow Step 6A (SELL signals execute BEFORE BUY signals)

---

#### 3. BUY Conviction Filtering Threshold
**Files Modified**:
- `sentinel_morning_workflow.py:589-618`
- `sentinel_evening_workflow.py:586-615`

**Feature**: Added `BUY_CONVICTION_THRESHOLD = 70` (out of 100)

**Rationale**:
- Only execute BUY signals with conviction ‚â•70
- Avoids marginal trades that consume capital without strong edge
- Low-conviction signals are logged but not executed
- With 70+ threshold, system only commits capital to high-conviction opportunities

**Important**: SELL signals still execute regardless of conviction (safety first - exit deteriorating positions immediately)

**Logging**: Detailed logs show which signals were filtered:
```
BUY signal filtering: 12/18 above 70 threshold
  Filtered out: XYZ (conviction: 65)
  Filtered out: ABC (conviction: 58)
```

---

#### 4. Real-Time Market Context Integration
**Files Modified**:
- `sentinel_morning_workflow.py:183-192, 225, 239`
- `sentinel_evening_workflow.py:180-189, 225, 239`

**Feature**: Integrated Perplexity market overview at start of Step 5 (before Tier 2/3 analysis)

**Replaces**: Hardcoded placeholder "Market conditions vary - see detailed analysis"

**Provides to Tier 2 & Tier 3**:
- Real-time market sentiment (bullish/bearish/mixed)
- Economic data releases and Fed commentary
- Sector rotation and leadership
- Geopolitical events affecting markets
- VIX and volatility trends

**Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to generic context if Perplexity API fails

**Impact**: AI analysis now has current market context instead of analyzing "blind"

---

#### 5. Morning Workflow Implementation
**New File**: `sentinel_morning_workflow.py`

Complete morning execution workflow (9 AM PT / Noon ET) with all Week 3 features integrated:
- ‚úÖ BUY conviction filtering (70/100 threshold)
- ‚úÖ Real-time Perplexity market overview
- ‚úÖ SELL-then-BUY sequencing for cash management
- ‚úÖ Conviction-based position sizing (1-100 scale)
- ‚úÖ Graceful error handling and fallbacks

**Workflow Steps**:
1. Initialize logging and connections
2. Check market hours (abort if market closed)
3. Fetch current positions and calculate available cash
4. Tier 1: Technical filtering (~3000 stocks ‚Üí ~300 candidates)
5. Tier 2: AI screening with market context (~300 ‚Üí ~70 finalists)
6. Tier 3: Deep conviction analysis with news (~70 ‚Üí BUY/SELL/HOLD)
7. Step 6A: Execute SELL signals (free cash first)
8. Step 6B: Execute BUY signals (filtered by conviction ‚â•70)

### Known Issues & Limitations ‚ö†Ô∏è

1. **Stock Universe Hardcoded**
   - Currently limited to 40 handpicked tickers
   - Need configuration system to choose: 40 / SP500 / Russell 3000
   - Priority: MEDIUM (testing convenience vs scalability)

2. **Zero Testing Performed**
   - All Week 3 features are untested
   - Need comprehensive dry-run before live trading
   - Priority: CRITICAL (testing required before going live)

3. **PDT Compliance Validation Pending**
   - No explicit day trade counting logic visible
   - Need to verify system prevents 4th day trade in 5-day window
   - Priority: HIGH (paper trading account can still be suspended for 90 days)

4. **Analytics Placeholders**
   - Win rate, avg win/loss, profit factor still using placeholder values
   - Can be calculated from `conviction_sells` and filled orders
   - Priority: LOW (cosmetic, doesn't affect trading logic)

---

## Glossary

**Conviction Score**: 1-100 rating of trade quality. Higher scores get more capital allocation.

**Tier 1**: Technical filtering using pandas_ta indicators. Fast, cheap, filters 3000 ‚Üí 300.

**Tier 2**: AI-powered screening using GPT-3.5-Turbo. Moderate cost, filters 300 ‚Üí 70.

**Tier 3**: Deep conviction analysis using Perplexity (news) + GPT-4-Turbo (analysis). Expensive, filters 70 ‚Üí final BUY/SELL/HOLD decisions.

**Stop-Loss Only Architecture**: Every entry has protective stop, no profit targets. Lets winners run, cuts losers quickly.

**PDT (Pattern Day Trader)**: SEC rule limiting accounts <$25K to 3 day trades per 5 business days. Paper trading accounts still subject to 90-day suspension for violations.

**Conviction Sells**: Exits triggered by Tier 3 analysis (deteriorating fundamentals) vs stop-loss exits (price-based).
