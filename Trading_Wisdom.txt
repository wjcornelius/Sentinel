Claude Sonnet 4.5 | Post-GPT-5 Critique Integration
Account: $5K-$100K | Posture: Moderately Aggressive | Format: AI-optimized
CRITICAL FRAMEWORK REVISIONS
Account Scaling Tiers (Operational Reality)
Tier 1 ($5K-$15K): 5-8 positions | r=1% per trade | order_value =0.1% ADV | long-only | large/mid-caps only (mkt_cap >$5B) | spread =20bps | ADV =$20M | max heat 5%

Tier 2 ($15K-$50K): 8-15 positions | r=1-1.5% per trade | order_value =0.15% ADV | allow selective mid-caps (mkt_cap $2-5B) | spread =25bps | ADV =$15M | max heat 6% | consider 5-10% tactical SPY puts when VIX>25

Tier 3 ($50K-$100K): 12-25 positions | r=1.5-2% per trade | order_value =0.25% ADV | allow small-caps (mkt_cap $500M-$2B) if spread =20bps AND ADV =$30M | max heat 8% | 10-15% hedge allocation optional

Dynamic heat caps (all tiers): heat_cap = min(tier_max, 4% × 20/VIX, floor 3%). Sector/factor bucket =40% of heat_cap. Any two correlated buckets =60% heat_cap.

Position Sizing - Enhanced Methodology
Base formula: shares = (equity × r) / (stop_distance + expected_slippage)

Stop distance: max(2×ATR20, 1.5×gap_risk_estimate)

Gap risk estimate: overnight_s × 2 (use 60-day rolling overnight returns std dev)

Expected slippage: s_exp = 0.5×spread + 0.1×s_1min + regime_multiplier

regime_multiplier: 1.0 if VIX<20, 1.5 if VIX 20-30, 2.5 if VIX>30
Correlation adjustment: effective_r = r × (1 - ?_iM × ß_iM) where ?_iM = correlation to market, ß_iM = beta to market

Portfolio-level constraint: Compute CVaR95 daily. If projected CVaR95 > tier_heat_cap, reduce all position sizes proportionally.

Execution Framework - Precision Spec
Order types (never pure market orders except stop-outs):

Entry: Marketable limit = mid ± 0.5×spread, max slippage cap s_max = min(10bps, 0.25×spread)
Stop-out: Marketable limit with slippage cap or market order if gap-through
Normal exit: Limit at favorable price with 15min timeout, then marketable limit
Cancel-replace: Every 500ms, max 5 attempts, then accept current best or cancel
Entry timing windows:

Primary: 10:00-15:30 ET (avoid open/close volatility)
Exits: anytime required, but prefer 10:00-15:30
Never enter day-before earnings/FOMC/CPI
Never enter in first 5 minutes (10:30 ET earliest for entries)
Slippage budget enforcement:

Track realized slippage per trade: actual_fill vs. signal_close
CUSUM monitor: if mean slippage deteriorates >10bps over 50 trades, trigger review
If effective spread consistently >0.6× quoted spread median after 100 trades, adjust tactics or abandon venue
Venue assumptions (Alpaca):

Smart routing to best execution (mixture of exchanges, dark pools, internalizers)
Cannot predict venue ? require empirical calibration
First 100 trades = calibration period: log every fill, compute effective spread distribution
Adjust slippage model to match reality
Risk Management - Advanced Protocols
Kelly Criterion (corrected):

Formula: f* = p - q/R where p=win_rate, q=1-p, R=avg_win/avg_loss
For variable outcomes: f* = µ/s² on log returns (requires distributional assumptions)
Hard prohibition: Never use Kelly without =1,000 OOS trades
Conservative application: Use ¼-Kelly maximum with Bayesian shrinkage on p and R estimates
Practical reality: Fixed fractional at 1-2% safer for retail; Kelly academic exercise only
Portfolio heat (dynamic VIX-based):

heat_cap = min(tier_max, 4% × 20/VIX, floor 3%)
Heat = S(open_position_risks) where position_risk = equity × r × position_count
Sector caps: max 40% heat per GICS sector
Factor cluster caps: Tech+CommSvc+Semis =60%, Financials+RealEstate =60%, Energy+Materials =60%
Use rolling 60-day correlation matrix, update weekly
Drawdown intervention (enhanced):

Equity DD 10%: Reduce new position sizing 50% (r ? 0.5×r), review all open positions, tighten trailing stops 20%
Equity DD 15%: Close highest-risk 30% of positions (largest loss, lowest momentum), halt new entries, full diagnostic
Equity DD 20%: Close all positions, cease trading, assume strategy broken until proven otherwise
Volatility circuit: If single-day portfolio loss > 3× rolling 20-day daily s_portfolio, immediate close-only mode
Time limit: If underwater >90 days regardless of magnitude, halt and full redesign
Gap-through protocol:

Stops ineffective on overnight gaps
If gap-through detected (open beyond stop by >1.5×ATR), accept open price, then exit at first liquidity opportunity where price > VWAP - k×s_intraday (k=1.5)
Position sizing must account for gap risk: include 1.5×gap_risk_estimate in stop_distance
Disaster scenarios:

LULD halt: Cancel all stops, set contingent MOC/LOC order for next session, reduce position size 50% post-halt
Circuit breaker: Close-only mode, no new entries until market normalized (2 consecutive days no circuit breaker)
Broker outage: Pre-establish backup broker (Interactive Brokers), practice failover quarterly, maintain auth credentials current
API failure: Retry 3× exponential backoff, if fail close positions manually via web interface, log for post-mortem
Backtesting - Falsification Standards
Data integrity requirements:

Point-in-time universe (survivorship-free database) OR apply -2% annual death tax + 1% random delisting events with -50% shock
Corporate actions: simulate splits/dividends at correct timestamps (ex-date, pay-date), use adjusted prices for analytics, raw prices for execution simulation
Earnings calendar: lag availability 1 trading day after actual announcement
Fundamental data: use filing date + 2 days for availability (SEC EDGAR lag)
Quote data: use SIP-equivalent (not direct feed) for backtest to match live Alpaca data quality
Look-ahead prevention:

Compute all indicators incrementally in chronological simulation loop
Never use future data for current decisions (includes restated financials, index membership changes, de-listings)
Stop triggers: simulate on raw unadjusted intraday data, but P&L on adjusted close series
Gap modeling: use actual overnight returns distribution, don't assume perfect stop execution
Overfitting controls:

Combinatorially Symmetric Cross-Validation (CSCV) with 10 folds minimum
Deflated Sharpe Ratio (DSR) mandatory reporting: accounts for multiple testing, must have DSR>0
White's Reality Check or Hansen's SPA test for strategy comparison
Parameter sensitivity: vary each ±20%, if performance drops >30%, flag as overfit
Degrees of freedom: require 30 trades per parameter (stricter than original 20)
Multiple testing correction:

Pre-register hypothesis before testing
Document all parameter combinations tested
Apply Bonferroni correction: if tested N variations, require p < 0.05/N for significance
Alternative: use CSCV which inherently corrects for multiple comparisons
Minimum validation standards:

Trades =500 total (OOS =200)
OOS period =40% of total, chronologically later, must include crisis period
DSR > 0 (corrected for multiple testing)
Profit Factor > 1.4 post-costs (stricter than 1.5 due to cost model improvements)
MAR (CAGR/MaxDD) > 0.6
MaxDD < 20%
Turnover < 300% annually (unless PF>1.7 which justifies higher friction)
Cost per trade = 40% of expected edge per trade
Red flags (refined):

Win rate >75% AND reward:risk <0.8 AND PF<1.6 (three conditions together, not just WR alone)
Sharpe >3.0 with <300 trades (noise vs. skill indistinguishable)
Single best trade >15% total profit (fragility)
IS/OOS performance ratio <0.7 (severe overfitting)
Parameter values at search boundary limits (arbitrary constraints binding)
Execution realism:

Slippage model: 0.5×spread + 0.1×s_1min + regime_multiplier
Queue position model for limit orders: fill_probability = e^(-d/d) where d=distance from mid (bps), d˜5-10bps for large-caps
Commission/fees: SEC fee ˜$0.0000278 per $1 sold, FINRA TAF varies (check current rates annually), effective total ˜0.01-0.02% per side
Round-trip cost: large-cap 0.05-0.15%, mid-cap 0.15-0.40%, small-cap 0.40-1.5%
Universe Selection - Point-in-Time Rules
Weekly universe refresh (Friday close):

Inclusion criteria:

Price =$5 (avoid penny stock mechanics)
ADV =$20M (Tier 1), =$15M (Tier 2 mid-caps), =$30M (Tier 3 small-caps)
Effective spread =20bps (large-cap), =25bps (mid-cap), =20bps (small-cap if allowed)
Float =$500M (reduces manipulation risk)
Market cap: Tier 1 =$5B, Tier 2 =$2B, Tier 3 =$500M
Exclude: ADRs, ETFs, SPACs, preferred shares
Exclude: Biotech/pharma <$1B market cap (binary event risk)
Earnings exclusion: no entry within ±5 trading days of earnings announcement
Liquidity verification:

Monitor: if intraday volume drops <50% of 20-day average, flag for review
Exit constraint: target exit in <5% of daily volume (2% comfortable, 5% maximum)
Corporate actions handling:

Monitor daily for splits, dividends, spin-offs
Adjust positions post-split immediately
Dividend: capture if ex-date >3 days away, otherwise neutral (close before ex-date to avoid capture inefficiency)
Strategy Signals - Momentum Framework
Signal candidates (moderately aggressive posture):

63-day return in top decile (relative to universe)
252-day return in top quintile (longer-term confirmation)
10-day pullback from recent high: -1s to -2s (volatility-adjusted dip-buy)
Relative strength rank (vs. SPY): top 20%
Volume confirmation: 20-day average volume increasing (avoid declining liquidity names)
Regime filters (activation gates):

Primary: SPY > 200-day MA OR market breadth z-score > -0.5
Secondary: VIX < 35 (above 35 = extreme stress, close-only)
Volatility adjustment: If VIX 25-35, reduce position sizes 50%, widen stops 50%
Deactivation: Breadth z-score < -1.0 AND SPY < 200-day MA ? close-only mode, resume after 10 days above activation gate
Market breadth calculation:

% of S&P500 above 200-day MA
Compute z-score: (current% - 5yr_mean) / 5yr_std_dev
Use quantiles not fixed thresholds: Q2 (20th percentile) = weak, Q8 (80th percentile) = strong
Factor exposure monitoring:

Track daily: ß_MKT, ß_SIZE, ß_VAL, ß_MOM using 60-day rolling regression
Alert if exposure change >0.2 in single week (portfolio drift)
Momentum attribution: if ß_MOM explains >80% of returns and alpha t-stat <2, strategy has no edge beyond factor exposure
Entry and Exit Rules
Entry execution:

Signal generated at close, enter next day 10:00-15:30 ET
Use marketable limit: mid ± 0.5×spread, slippage cap s_max
Cancel-replace every 500ms, max 5 attempts
If unfilled after 5 attempts, skip trade (adverse selection likely)
Log: signal timestamp, intended entry, actual fill, slippage, queue distance
Stop loss (hard stops, automated):

Initial: max(2×ATR20, 1.5×gap_risk)
Trailing: ratchet at 2×ATR from local max, never loosen
Execution: convert to marketable limit on trigger, accept slippage within s_max
Gap-through: accept morning open if beyond stop, exit per protocol above
Time-based exits:

Max hold: 30 trading days (momentum regime assumption)
If no new high-water-mark after 10 days AND breadth deteriorates (z<0), reduce position 50%
If no new HWM after 20 days, close position entirely (momentum exhausted)
Profit targets (optional, not required):

Consider taking 50% position off at +2R (where R = initial risk)
Trail remainder with tighter stop (1.5×ATR instead of 2×ATR)
Ensure profit-taking doesn't reduce R:R below 1.5:1 on average
Earnings blackout:

Automatic close 5 days before earnings if hold period would overlap
Hard filter: never enter if earnings within ±5 days
Exception: if earnings >10 days away and position up >10%, trail stop aggressively but hold
Operational Risk Controls
PDT (Pattern Day Trader) constraints:

Accounts <$25K: max 3 day-trades per rolling 5-day period
Swing system should rarely trigger, but monitor: if entry and exit same day, counts as day-trade
Alternative: use cash account (no margin) to avoid PDT rule, accept T+2 settlement (reduces buying power)
Wash sale rule (US tax):

If close position at loss, cannot repurchase same/substantially identical security within 30 days
Implement 31-day exclusion: if sold at loss, exclude from universe for 31 days
Use FIFO tax lots unless specific lot IDs managed (complexity vs. benefit)
Short selling constraints (if implemented):

Alpaca borrow availability limited and variable
Check HTB (hard-to-borrow) status before short entry
Model borrow fee: if >10% annualized for hold >5 days, skip short
Require short rebate + edge > borrow cost
SSR (Short Sale Restriction): if stock down >10% from prior close, use D-PEG limit orders or skip entry
Recommendation: Start long-only, add short module only after 6 months live validation
API/broker health monitoring:

Real-time alerts: order reject rate >2%, quote staleness >1sec, API latency >500ms
Daily health check: connection drops, missed heartbeats, order submission failures
Failover: if Alpaca down >30min and positions open, use web interface manual control
Practice emergency procedures quarterly (simulated outage drills)
Compliance guards (hard blocks):

PDT guard: count day-trades, block if limit reached
Borrow/locate guard: verify availability before short
Earnings guard: block entry if earnings within ±5 days
SSR guard: block or adjust short entry tactics on SSR day
LULD guard: detect halt, cancel orders, implement halt protocol
Regime Awareness - Enhanced Framework
Regime identification (daily assessment):

Trend regime: SPY > 200dma AND breadth z > 0 ? momentum strategies favored, mean-reversion weak
Chop regime: SPY oscillating ±5% around 200dma AND breadth z between -0.5 and 0.5 ? reduce position count 30%, widen stops 20%
Bear regime: SPY < 200dma AND breadth z < -0.5 ? close-only mode until recovery
High-vol regime: VIX > 25 ? reduce sizes 50%, widen stops 50%, max positions -30%
Crisis regime: VIX > 35 ? close-only, no new entries

Correlation regime:

Compute rolling 60-day correlation matrix of holdings
Average pairwise correlation: <0.3 = low (diversification works), 0.3-0.6 = moderate, >0.6 = high (macro-driven, diversification fails)
High correlation ? reduce position count, increase per-position quality threshold
Adaptation tactics:

Multi-strategy future state: run trend + mean-reversion, weight by regime detection
Current state (single momentum strategy): conditional activation based on regime gates above
Parameter adjustment: dynamic stops and sizes per regime (already specified)
Regime shift detection:

Don't try to predict shifts (whipsaw risk)
Respond to confirmed shifts with 3-5 day lag (accept lag cost, avoid false signals)
Confirmation: require regime indicator breach + 3 consecutive days confirmation
Monitoring and Intervention
Real-time alerts (immediate action required):

Single position loss >2.5× expected (stop failure, news, gap)
Portfolio heat exceeds dynamic cap (correlation spike or sizing error)
API/data errors (stale quotes, failed orders, rejected submissions)
Drawdown acceleration: >5% equity drop in single day
Execution slippage >3× expected (market impact or venue issue)
Daily review (within 24hr):

Profit Factor deviation: if trailing 20 trades PF <1.2, investigate
Win rate deviation: if |actual - expected| > 15%, investigate regime mismatch
Average R:R deviation: if |actual - expected| > 25%, investigate exits
Correlation to SPY shift: if ?? > 0.2 from baseline, check factor exposure
Consecutive losses: compute expected streak E[L] ˜ ln(1-a)/ln(1-p), alert if observed > E[L] + 2s
Weekly review (strategic check):

Rolling 20-trade Sharpe Ratio: if SR < 0.5, flag for deep review
MaxDD relative to historical: if current DD > 0.75× historical max, tighten risk
Regime indicators: trend, volatility, correlation, breadth ? confirm strategy alignment
Sector/factor exposure: heat distribution, concentration risk
Execution quality: slippage distribution, fill rate, venue effectiveness
Monthly review (comprehensive audit):

Full performance attribution: alpha, beta, factor exposures
Compare actual vs. expected across all metrics (PF, WR, R:R, Sharpe, MAR, turnover)
Deflated Sharpe Ratio: recalculate with growing trial count
Edge decay analysis: rolling 12-month vs. prior 12-month performance delta
Cost attribution: effective spread, timing cost, fees, market impact
Update forward assumptions based on trailing 6-month realized statistics
Kill-switch criteria (halt trading immediately):

Live SR over last 50 trades < 0 AND DSR < 0 with 95% confidence
Drawdown exceeds 1.5× historical max
Three consecutive monthly losses below expectation
Correlation to SPY > 0.85 (no alpha, just beta)
ß_MOM attribution >80% of returns with alpha t-stat <2 (no edge beyond factor)
Fundamental assumption invalidated (e.g., liquidity crisis, regime shift, broker policy change)
Edge Decay and Adaptation
Alpha half-life (strategy lifecycle expectations):

Simple momentum patterns: 2-4 years productive life
Multi-factor with regime adaptation: 3-7 years
Behavioral edges: 5-10 years (slower decay, harder to arbitrage)
Decay monitoring:

Rolling 12-month Sharpe vs. prior 12-month: if delta SR < -0.3, edge decaying
Bayesian drift model: posterior probability that current edge < historical edge by >30%
If P(decay) > 0.7, begin successor development
Retirement criteria: 12-month SR drop >50% with DSR significance p<0.05
Continuous research pipeline:

Allocate 10-20% development time to new strategy research (even when current strategy working)
Paper trade new concepts minimum 50 trades before live allocation
Maintain 2-3 strategy candidates in shadow mode (parallel paper trading)
Begin successor integration at Year 2 of current strategy (before decay obvious)
Complexity management during adaptation:

Resist complexity creep: each new component must justify via CSCV
Addition criteria: improves OOS DSR by >0.1 OR reduces MaxDD by >2% while maintaining DSR
Simplicity budget: start 3-5 parameters, max 12 parameters lifetime
If >12 parameters, fork into separate strategy rather than bloat existing
Success Metrics - Realistic Targets
Moderately aggressive posture (risk-tolerant but not reckless):

Target performance:

Net CAGR: 15-25% (12-20% conservative, 25-35% aggressive but unsustainable)
Sharpe Ratio: 1.2-1.8 (>2.0 suspicious, <1.0 inadequate)
MAR (CAGR/MaxDD): =0.7 (prefer >1.0)
Max Drawdown: 12-18% (acceptable), 20% absolute max (intervention threshold)
Profit Factor: 1.5-2.2 post-costs
Win Rate: 45-60% (depends on R:R, not standalone metric)
Average R:R: 1.5:1 to 2.5:1
Turnover: 150-250% annually (higher if justified by PF>1.7)
Tracking error vs. SPY: >10% (indicates true alpha, not just beta)

Cost efficiency: Total cost per trade <40bps, effective spread realization <0.6× quoted spread

Consistency: No single month >30% of annual returns (diversified across time)

Abandonment criteria (after 200 live trades minimum):

PF < 1.2 sustained
DSR = 0 (no statistical edge after multiple testing correction)
Cost per trade > 40% of edge per trade
Live/OOS PF ratio < 0.7 (severe live degradation)
Sharpe ratio < 0.5 over 6 months
Correlation to SPY > 0.85 with alpha t-stat < 2
Technology and Infrastructure
Data sources:

Development: Polygon.io or IEX Cloud for deep historical (survivorship-free if possible)
Live: Alpaca SIP data (acknowledge limitations: gaps, latency, occasional errors)
Missing bar sentinel: halt if >1% bars missing in any day
Corporate actions: Alpha Vantage or similar for splits/dividends feed
Code infrastructure:

Version control: Git with tagged releases for each deployment
Backtesting: reproducible (fixed random seed, code hash, dependency versions)
Shadow mode: 2 weeks parallel paper trading before any code change goes live
Feature flags: gradual rollout capability (A/B test new components)
Audit trail: immutable append-only logs for all decisions, orders, fills
Order management:

Idempotency keys on all orders (prevent duplicates)
Order state machine: pending ? submitted ? filled/rejected/canceled
Timeout handling: cancel stale orders after 5min unfilled (except close-only mode)
Error retry: 3 attempts with exponential backoff (100ms, 300ms, 900ms)
Security:

API keys: scoped permissions (trade vs. read-only), rotated quarterly
Secrets management: never hardcode, use environment variables or vault
Rate limiting: respect Alpaca limits (200 req/min), implement client-side throttle
Circuit breaker: halt on repeated duplicate order submissions (bug protection)
Disaster recovery:

Position reconciliation: daily comparison expected vs. actual positions
Backup broker: Interactive Brokers credentials maintained, tested quarterly
Manual override: web interface access for emergency position closing
Communication: SMS/email alerts for critical failures (not every trade)
Cognitive Bias Mitigation (Operationalized)
Preregistration discipline:

Document hypothesis before testing: "Strategy X will have Sharpe >1.5 because Y causal mechanism"
Log all parameter combinations tested, not just successful ones
Calculate and report multiple testing correction
Hindsight bias prevention:

Log ALL signals generated, not just trades taken
Calculate signal-to-noise: signals_generated / trades_taken
If S/N >5, filter likely overfit (cherry-picking)
Review false signals: why didn't they work? Pattern or random?
Recency bias prevention:

Require 3+ year validation window
Equal weight to distant periods: test on 2008-09, 2015-16, 2018, 2020, 2022
Out-of-regime testing: if recent = low-vol trend, specifically test high-vol chop periods
Confirmation bias prevention:

CSCV inherently reduces confirmation bias (strategy must work across many splits)
Devil's advocate review: monthly, explicitly argue why strategy might fail
Disconfirming evidence: seek data that contradicts strategy assumption
Survivorship bias prevention:

Use point-in-time databases OR apply -2% annual death tax + random delisting shocks
Assume ~10% of holdings delist/fail over 10 years
Model delisting with -50% shock (bankruptcy scenario)
What Actually Matters - Revised Priority
Critical 20% (80% of outcome):

Position sizing discipline: Prevents ruin, enables compounding (40% of importance)
Stop loss adherence: Caps losses, preserves capital for next opportunity (25%)
Execution quality: Preserves edge against friction (15%)
Universe selection and liquidity: Determines tradeable opportunity set (10%)
Regime awareness: Prevents fighting tape, aligns strategy to environment (10%)
Important but secondary:

Entry timing optimization: ±2-4% impact if done well
Exit timing beyond stops: ±3-5% impact
Tax optimization: ±1-4% annual (meaningful but not critical)
Portfolio construction: ±3-7% if <30 positions (diversification marginal)
Often overweighted (minimal impact):

Indicator selection (RSI vs. MACD vs. Stochastic): <1% difference
Chart pattern recognition: low reliability, high subjectivity
News sentiment analysis: already priced by time retail accesses
Social media signals: noise ratio extreme
Guru/newsletter recommendations: negative expected value
Development focus sequence:

Prove edge exists (rigorous backtest, realistic costs, CSCV, DSR>0)
Implement risk management (position sizing, stops, heat limits, regime gates)
Optimize execution (order types, timing, slippage minimization)
Validate robustness (parameter sensitivity, walk-forward, out-of-regime)
THEN and only then: optimize entry/exit nuances
Premature optimization remains #1 killer. Build foundation before refinements.
