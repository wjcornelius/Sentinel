## PART 1: CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS (v6.2)

### What Sentinel Actually Does Today

**Core Function:** AI-driven momentum trading system for U.S. equities
- Automated daily workflow (morning + evening cycles)
- Paper trading on Alpaca API (live market data, simulated execution)
- Portfolio: ~59 positions, $102K paper account value
- Strategy: Long-only momentum with stop-losses

### Architecture Overview (Actual Codebase)

**Main Workflows:**
1. `sentinel_morning_workflow.py` - Daily execution (10:00 AM)
   - Reconciles portfolio with broker
   - Generates signals from three-tier analysis
   - Submits orders (BUY + stop-loss pairs)
   - Creates 8 stop orders in last run

2. `sentinel_evening_workflow.py` - End-of-day review
   - Performance analysis
   - Position updates
   - Prepares next day

3. `main_script.py` - Legacy single-script system (being phased out?)

**Core Modules (`sentinel/` package):**

**Tier 1: Technical Filter** (`tier1_technical_filter.py`)
- Basic liquidity/technical screens
- Market cap, volume, price filters
- Eliminates 80-90% of universe

**Tier 2: AI Screening** (`tier2_ai_screening.py`)
- GPT-4 Turbo fundamental screening
- Passes ~50 candidates to Tier 3

**Tier 3: Conviction Analysis** (`tier3_conviction_analysis.py`)
- GPT-4 Turbo deep analysis
- Generates conviction scores (0-100)
- Outputs ~15-20 recommendations

**Portfolio Optimizer** (`portfolio_optimizer.py`)
- **GPT-5** holistic optimization
- Sees ALL Tier 3 scores + portfolio state
- Makes globally optimal decisions
- Solves "sequential decision problem"

**Universe Definition** (`universe.py`)
- S&P 500 + Nasdaq 100 (~600 stocks)
- Deduplicated, alphabetically sorted

**Supporting Modules:**
- `execution_engine.py` - Order submission to Alpaca
- `perplexity_news.py` - Market news aggregation
- `context_builder.py` - Data gathering for AI
- `analytics.py` - Performance metrics
- `risk_config.py` - Position sizing, risk limits
- `constants.py` - System-wide configuration

**Database:** SQLite (`sentinel.db`)
- `positions` - Current holdings
- `trade_history` - Execution log
- `daily_snapshots` - Performance tracking

**Utilities:**
- `create_missing_stops.py` - Backfill stop orders
- `verify_stops.py` - Audit stop coverage
- `clear_today_plan.py` - Reset daily state
- `backup_database.py` - Data preservation
- `sentinel_dashboard.py` - Performance UI

### What Works

‚úÖ **Three-tier analysis pipeline** - Functional, produces signals
‚úÖ **GPT-5 optimizer** - Upgraded from GPT-4, working
‚úÖ **Alpaca integration** - Live data, order submission working
‚úÖ **Stop-loss system** - Creates stop orders automatically
‚úÖ **Database persistence** - Tracks history reliably
‚úÖ **Paper trading** - Running live without real capital risk

### What Doesn't Work / Issues Identified

‚ùå **Margin usage problem** - Account showing negative cash (-$51K)
- Portfolio value $102K, but using margin inappropriately
- Likely sizing algorithm not respecting cash constraint

‚ùå **Too few SELL signals** - System biased toward holding
- 59 positions, only 51 had stops initially
- Not generating enough exit signals

‚ùå **Output confusion** - User doesn't understand what system is doing
- Needs clearer reporting
- Decision transparency lacking

‚ùå **No "already traded today" check** - Can double-execute
- Documented in CHANGELOG as missing feature
- Risk of duplicate orders

‚ùå **No CLI arguments** - Hardcoded parameters
- Can't easily switch modes or configurations

‚ùå **Aggressive filtering** - 83% rejection rate (Tier 1)
- May be too strict, missing opportunities

### Technical Debt & Architecture Issues

**Fragmentation:**
- `main_script.py` vs `sentinel_morning_workflow.py` - Which is canonical?
- Legacy code vs. new modular architecture
- Unclear migration path

**Documentation vs Reality:**
- README.md describes v6.2 workflow
- CHANGELOG.md documents recent changes
- WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL.md describes three-party collaboration
- START_HERE_WHEN_YOU_RETURN.txt references old single-script approach
- Documentation inconsistency indicates evolution without cleanup

**Testing:**
- `test_morning_workflow_dry_run.py` exists
- `test_error_handling.py` exists
- Coverage unknown, integration testing unclear

**Deployment:**
- Paper trading confirmed working
- Live trading capability exists but not activated
- Risk management framework defined in Trading_Wisdom.txt
- Account tier logic (Tier 1: $5K-$15K, Tier 2: $15K-$50K, Tier 3: $50K-$100K)

## PART 2: VISION GAP ANALYSIS

### What I've Seen About Transformation

**Documents Reviewed:**
1. ‚úÖ **Trading_Wisdom.txt** (just added to repo)
   - Comprehensive risk management framework
   - Account tier structure
   - Position sizing methodology
   - Backtesting standards
   - Edge decay monitoring
   - **THIS IS OPERATIONAL DOCTRINE, NOT TRANSFORMATION VISION**

2. ‚úÖ **CORPORATE_CHARTER_Sentinel Corp_v1.0.md** (in repo but not reviewed yet)
   - Contains "corporation" and "avatar" references
   - **NEED TO READ THIS**

3. ‚úÖ **START_HERE_WHEN_YOU_RETURN.txt**
   - Describes "Pillars" architecture
   - References "Context Manager" role for human
   - Single-strategy focus

4. ‚úÖ **WORKFLOW_PROTOCOL.md**
   - Three-party collaboration (Human, Claude PoE, Claude Code)
   - Does NOT describe departmental avatars
   - Does NOT describe corporate transformation

### What I DON'T Understand

**üö® CRITICAL GAPS:**

1. **Departmental Avatar System** - What is this?
   - You mentioned "departmental avatars" in your message
   - I see NO code implementation of this
   - I see NO architectural documentation of this
   - Is this the transformation target?

2. **"Sentinel Corporation" Concept**
   - CORPORATE_CHARTER file exists but not yet reviewed
   - What departments exist?
   - What roles do avatars play?
   - How does this replace current architecture?

3. **Preservation vs Rebuild Question**
   - Current system: monolithic AI-driven workflow
   - Target system: departmental avatar structure?
   - Which components survive?
   - Which get replaced?

4. **Migration Path**
   - Is v6.2 the "before" state?
   - What is the "after" state?
   - Incremental transformation or clean-slate rebuild?

5. **Trading_Wisdom.txt Role**
   - This is a 27KB risk management bible
   - Does this apply to NEW architecture or OLD?
   - Who enforces these rules in avatar system?
   - Is there a "Risk Management Avatar"?

## PART 4: MISSING DOCUMENTATION (Please Provide)

**Priority 1 - Architecture:**
1. Target departmental structure diagram
2. Avatar interface specifications
3. Inter-avatar communication protocol
4. Data flow through new system

**Priority 2 - Migration:**
1. v6.2 ‚Üí Corporation mapping
2. Deprecation timeline
3. Parallel run strategy
4. Rollback plan

**Priority 3 - Operational:**
1. How Trading_Wisdom.txt applies to new architecture
2. How three-party workflow (Human/PoE/Code) changes
3. Development environment for multi-avatar system
4. Testing strategy for departmental interactions

---

## PART 5: RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

**Option A: Read CORPORATE_CHARTER First**
- You share raw URL to CORPORATE_CHARTER_Sentinel Corp_v1.0.md
- I read and understand vision
- We reconvene with better shared context

**Option B: You Draft Architecture Doc**
- You create DEPARTMENTAL_ARCHITECTURE.md
- Defines departments, avatars, interfaces, data flows
- I review and ask technical implementation questions

**Option C: Incremental Discovery**
- We start small: pick ONE department to prototype
- Example: "Risk Management Avatar"
- Build it, test it, learn from it
- Expand to other departments iteratively

**My Recommendation:** **Option A** (Read Charter) ‚Üí **Option B** (Architecture Doc) ‚Üí **Option C** (Incremental Build)

---

## CONCLUSION

**Current State:** v6.2 is a functional but flawed monolithic momentum trading system with GPT-5 optimization.

**Vision State:** Multi-departmental avatar-based "Sentinel Corporation" architecture (details unknown to me).

**Gap:** Massive architectural transformation required. Current code provides working primitives (Alpaca integration, GPT calls, database, risk logic) but does NOT provide departmental structure.

**Blocker:** I cannot create roadmap until I understand target architecture.

**Request:** Please provide vision documentation so I can bridge current state to target state.

**Status:** Awaiting Claude (PoE) guidance on transformation vision
**Files Ready for Review:**
- Trading_Wisdom.txt (now on repo)
- CORPORATE_CHARTER_Sentinel Corp_v1.0.md (awaiting your review request)
