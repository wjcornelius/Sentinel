## PROMPT 1 OF 3: CONTEXT SETTING

```
CONTEXT UPDATE (1 of 3)

Claude Code has fixed the .gitignore issue. Critical documentation is now
visible on the public GitHub repo:

- Trading_Wisdom.txt (27KB risk management framework)
- START_HERE_WHEN_YOU_RETURN.txt (project orientation)
- CORPORATE_CHARTER_Sentinel Corp_v1.0.md (already there, needs your review)

Claude Code has created a comprehensive current state assessment per your
directive. It includes:

1. Full technical inventory of v6.2 architecture
2. What works, what doesn't
3. Vision gap analysis (what he doesn't understand about transformation)
4. 10 specific questions for you
5. Request for vision documentation

Please wait for prompts 2 and 3 before responding.
```

## PROMPT 3 OF 3: FILE REVIEW REQUEST

```
FILE REVIEW REQUEST (3 of 3)

Please wait - do not respond yet. I will now provide URLs to files for your review:

1. Trading_Wisdom.txt (operational doctrine)
2. Current State Assessment (Claude Code's analysis)
3. CORPORATE_CHARTER (vision document - your call if needed now or later)

Standby for file URLs...
```

---

## FILE PROMPT 1 OF 3: TRADING WISDOM

```
FILE 1 OF 3: Trading_Wisdom.txt

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wjcornelius/Sentinel/main/Trading_Wisdom.txt

This is the 27KB operational risk management framework. Claude Code has read
this and understands it is NOT the transformation vision - it is operational
doctrine for trading operations.

Please acknowledge receipt. Two more files coming.
```

---

## FILE PROMPT 2 OF 3: CURRENT STATE ASSESSMENT

```
FILE 2 OF 3: Current State Assessment from Claude Code

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wjcornelius/Sentinel/main/Messages_For_Claude_Poe/2025-10-30_13-30_current-state-assessment.md

This is Claude Code's comprehensive analysis:
- Technical inventory of v6.2
- What he understands about current system
- What he DOESN'T understand about transformation
- 10 questions for you
- Recommended next steps

Please acknowledge receipt. One more file coming.
```

---

## FILE PROMPT 3 OF 3: CORPORATE CHARTER (OPTIONAL)

```
FILE 3 OF 3: Corporate Charter (Your Decision)

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wjcornelius/Sentinel/main/CORPORATE_CHARTER_Sentinel%20Corp_v1.0.md

This is the vision document Claude Code hasn't reviewed yet. He suspects this
contains the departmental avatar architecture definition.

OPTIONS:
A) You review it first, then explain it to Claude Code
B) Have Claude Code read it now alongside you
C) Skip it for now, you'll draft a clearer architecture doc

ALL FILES PROVIDED. Please respond to Claude Code's current state assessment,
including:
- Answers to his 10 questions
- Which missing documentation you'll provide
- What the next step should be

Thank you for your patience with the multi-file context loading.
```
