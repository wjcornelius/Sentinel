## What "Risk" Means at Sentinel Corporation

### Traditional Finance Risk (NOT US):
- High volatility = dangerous
- Wide stops = over-exposed
- Momentum stocks = speculative

### Sentinel Corporation Risk (OUR DEFINITION):
- **Stagnation Risk**: Stock doesn't move → capital eaten by inflation
- **Opportunity Cost Risk**: Boring stock clogs slot → missing better movers
- **Time Risk**: Takes >1 month to profit → wasted position slot
- **Illiquidity Risk**: Can't exit when needed → trapped capital
- **Excessive Leverage Risk**: Over-positioned → account blown

## Scoring Components (Each 0-25 points, Total 0-100)

### 1. Volatility Score (25 points max)
**What we want**: 20-40% annualized volatility (the "motion of the ocean")

| Volatility | Score | Reasoning |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| 25-35% | +25 | **PERFECT**: Sweet spot for swing trading |
| 20-25% or 35-40% | +20 | **EXCELLENT**: Still great swing trade range |
| 15-20% or 40-50% | +10 | **GOOD**: Acceptable edges |
| 10-15% or 50-60% | +5 | **MARGINAL**: Too boring or too hot |
| <10% | 0 | **TOO BORING**: No profit potential |
| >60% | 0 | **TOO VOLATILE**: Excessive risk |

**Rationale**: We need stocks that MOVE. Too little = no profit. Too much = unmanageable.

---

### 2. Risk/Reward Ratio Score (25 points max)
**What we want**: 2:1 or better (standard swing trading)

| R:R Ratio | Score | Reasoning |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| ≥3.0:1 | +25 | **EXCELLENT**: Strong reward potential |
| 2.5-3.0:1 | +20 | **VERY GOOD**: Solid setup |
| 2.0-2.5:1 | +15 | **GOOD**: Acceptable |
| 1.5-2.0:1 | +10 | **MARGINAL**: Minimum acceptable |
| <1.5:1 | 0 | **POOR**: Not worth the risk |

**Rationale**: We swing trade for asymmetric returns. Need at least 2:1 to justify the trade.

---

### 3. Stop Distance Score (25 points max)
**What we want**: 5-10% stop distance (room to run without over-risking)

| Stop Distance | Score | Reasoning |
|---------------|-------|-----------|
| 6-9% | +25 | **PERFECT**: Ideal room for swing trading |
| 5-6% or 9-10% | +20 | **EXCELLENT**: Good range |
| 4-5% or 10-12% | +15 | **GOOD**: Acceptable edges |
| 3-4% or 12-15% | +10 | **MARGINAL**: Getting tight/wide |
| <3% | +5 | **TOO TIGHT**: Death by 1000 cuts |
| >15% | +5 | **TOO WIDE**: Over-exposed per trade |

**Rationale**:
- <3% = Gets stopped out on normal noise
- 5-10% = Room for stock to breathe while protecting capital
- >15% = Over-risking per position

---

### 4. Position Risk Score (25 points max)
**What we want**: ≤1.5% of capital at risk per trade

| Risk % | Score | Reasoning |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| ≤0.75% | +25 | **CONSERVATIVE**: Safe position sizing |
| 0.75-1.0% | +20 | **GOOD**: Solid risk management |
| 1.0-1.5% | +15 | **ACCEPTABLE**: At target |
| 1.5-2.0% | +10 | **ELEVATED**: Getting aggressive |
| >2.0% | +5 | **EXCESSIVE**: Over-leveraged |

**Rationale**: With ~60 positions, need to manage total portfolio heat. Can't blow up account on one trade.
