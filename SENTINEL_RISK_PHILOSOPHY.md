## Mission Statement

Sentinel Corporation is an **inter-day swing trading system** designed to profit from market momentum over 1-4 week hold periods. We maintain approximately **60 positions** that constantly rotate to capture the best-performing stocks in the current market environment.

**We are breeding a racehorse, not a pony that gives rides at a carnival.**

## What "Risk" Means at Sentinel Corporation

### Traditional Finance Definition (NOT US):
Traditional risk management views:
- ✗ High volatility = dangerous
- ✗ Wide stop-losses = over-exposed
- ✗ Momentum stocks = speculative gambling
- ✗ Frequent trading = transaction costs

**This is pension fund thinking. This is NOT Sentinel Corporation.**

### Sentinel Corporation's Definition:
At Sentinel Corporation, "risk" means:

1. **Stagnation Risk**: Stock doesn't move → capital eroded by inflation
2. **Opportunity Cost Risk**: Boring stock clogs a position slot → missing better movers
3. **Time Risk**: Takes >1 month to profit → wasted position in portfolio
4. **Illiquidity Risk**: Can't exit when needed → trapped capital
5. **Excessive Leverage Risk**: Over-positioned on single trade → account destruction

**We embrace what traditional finance calls "risky":**
- ✓ Volatility 20-40% = "Motion of the ocean" (GOOD)
- ✓ Wide stops 5-10% = Room to run (GOOD)
- ✓ Momentum stocks = Trending moves (GOOD)
- ✓ High velocity = Constant rotation (GOOD)

## Swing Trading Requirements

### What Makes a Good Swing Trade for Sentinel:

**Volatility**: 20-40% annualized
- **Why**: Need stocks that MOVE. Price action creates profit opportunities.
- **Below 15%**: Too boring, limited profit potential, stagnation risk
- **Above 60%**: Too chaotic, unmanageable, excessive risk

**Stop Distance**: 5-10% from entry
- **Why**: Gives stock room to breathe while protecting capital
- **Below 3%**: Too tight, stopped out on noise, death by 1000 cuts
- **Above 15%**: Over-exposed, risking too much per trade

**Risk/Reward Ratio**: ≥2:1
- **Why**: Asymmetric returns - we swing trade for big wins, not small grinds
- **Below 1.5:1**: Not worth the risk, poor setup

**Position Size**: ≤1.5% of capital at risk
- **Why**: With ~60 positions, need managed portfolio heat
- **Above 2%**: Over-leveraged, account risk too high

**Hold Period**: 1-4 weeks
- **Why**: Capture momentum moves, not buy-and-hold
- **Above 1 month**: Clogs position slots, opportunity cost too high

## Risk Score Interpretation (0-100 Scale)

### All departments use 0-100 scoring where **HIGHER = BETTER**:

| Score | Grade | Meaning | Interpretation |
|-------|-------|---------|----------------|
| **90-100** | A+ | **EXCELLENT SWING TRADE** | Perfect volatility, setup, momentum - STRONG BUY |
| **80-89** | A | **VERY GOOD SWING TRADE** | Great setup, minor imperfections - GOOD BUY |
| **70-79** | B | **GOOD SWING TRADE** | Solid candidate, acceptable for portfolio - BUY |
| **60-69** | C | **ACCEPTABLE** | Decent but less exciting - CONSIDER if limited alternatives |
| **50-59** | D | **MARGINAL** | Either too boring OR borderline excessive risk - CAUTION |
| **40-49** | F | **POOR** | Not suitable for swing trading - AVOID |
| **0-39** | F- | **REJECT** | No swing trade potential - DO NOT TRADE |

---

## Scoring Consistency Across Departments

**CRITICAL**: All departments must use consistent 0-100 scaling where **HIGHER = BETTER**

### Department Score Meanings:

**Research Department** (Technical Analysis):
- 100 = Excellent technical setup (momentum, breakout, trend)
- 0 = Poor technicals (no setup, weak trend)

**News Department** (Sentiment):
- 100 = Very bullish sentiment
- 50 = Neutral sentiment
- 0 = Very bearish sentiment

**Risk Department** (Swing Trade Suitability):
- 100 = Excellent swing trade (optimal volatility + setup + R:R)
- 0 = Not suitable for swing trading (too boring OR too risky)

**Portfolio Department** (Overall Score):
- Weighted combination of all department scores
- Higher = Better candidate for portfolio

---

## Risk Score Components (Risk Department)

### The Risk Department calculates risk_score based on 4 components (25 points each):

### 1. Volatility Score (25 points)
**Target**: 20-40% annualized volatility

| Volatility | Points | Rationale |
|------------|--------|-----------|
| 25-35% | 25 | Perfect swing trading range |
| 20-25% or 35-40% | 20 | Excellent edges |
| 15-20% or 40-50% | 10 | Acceptable |
| 10-15% or 50-60% | 5 | Marginal (too boring or too hot) |
| <10% or >60% | 0 | Unsuitable |

### 2. Risk/Reward Ratio Score (25 points)
**Target**: ≥2:1 risk/reward

| R:R Ratio | Points | Rationale |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| ≥3.0:1 | 25 | Excellent asymmetric setup |
| 2.5-3.0:1 | 20 | Very good |
| 2.0-2.5:1 | 15 | Good minimum |
| 1.5-2.0:1 | 10 | Marginal |
| <1.5:1 | 0 | Not worth the risk |

### 3. Stop Distance Score (25 points)
**Target**: 5-10% from entry

| Stop Distance | Points | Rationale |
|---------------|--------|-----------|
| 6-9% | 25 | Perfect room to run |
| 5-6% or 9-10% | 20 | Excellent |
| 4-5% or 10-12% | 15 | Good |
| 3-4% or 12-15% | 10 | Marginal (tight or wide) |
| <3% | 5 | Too tight - death by cuts |
| >15% | 5 | Too wide - over-exposed |

### 4. Position Risk Score (25 points)
**Target**: ≤1.5% of capital at risk

| Risk % | Points | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| ≤0.75% | 25 | Conservative, safe |
| 0.75-1.0% | 20 | Good risk management |
| 1.0-1.5% | 15 | Acceptable target |
| 1.5-2.0% | 10 | Elevated, aggressive |
| >2.0% | 5 | Excessive, over-leveraged |

## Warning Categories

The Risk Department generates warnings (NOT rejections) in three categories:

### 1. "Too Boring for Swing Trading"
**Triggers**:
- Volatility <15%
- Stop distance <3%
- Overall score <60

**Meaning**: Stock lacks movement/profit potential - stagnation risk high

### 2. "Excessive Risk"
**Triggers**:
- Position risk >2.0% of capital
- Volatility >60%
- Stop distance >15%

**Meaning**: Over-exposed on this trade - account risk too high

### 3. "Poor Setup"
**Triggers**:
- R:R ratio <1.5:1
- Overall score <50

**Meaning**: Unfavorable risk/reward - not worth taking the trade

**NOTE**: Warnings are ADVISORY. Portfolio Optimizer (GPT-5) has final decision authority.

## Context Block for AI Departments

**USE THIS CONTEXT BLOCK** when GPT-5, CEO, or any AI department interprets risk scores:

```
SENTINEL CORPORATION RISK PHILOSOPHY (Required Context)
========================================================

Mission: Inter-day swing trading, 1-4 week holds, ~60 positions
Style: Aggressive momentum-based swing trading ("breeding a racehorse")

RISK DEFINITION:
- Risk = opportunity cost + stagnation + time waste
- NOT traditional "volatility = danger" thinking

WHAT WE WANT:
✓ Volatility 20-40%: Motion of the ocean (GOOD)
✓ Wide stops 5-10%: Room to run (GOOD)
✓ Momentum stocks: Trending moves (GOOD)
✓ High liquidity: Easy exit (GOOD)

WHAT WE AVOID:
✗ Stagnant stocks: Capital eaten by inflation (BAD)
✗ Tight stops <3%: Death by 1000 cuts (BAD)
✗ Low volatility <15%: No profit potential (BAD)
✗ Long holds >1 month: Clogs precious slots (BAD)

RISK_SCORE INTERPRETATION (0-100, HIGHER = BETTER):
100 = EXCELLENT swing trade setup
75-99 = GOOD swing trade
50-74 = MARGINAL (either too boring OR too risky)
0-49 = AVOID (no swing trade potential)

EXAMPLE SCORES:
- TSLA (high volatility momentum): 85-95 ← OUR SWEET SPOT
- AAPL (moderate blue chip): 65-75 ← ACCEPTABLE
- KO (low volatility dividend): 30-40 ← TOO BORING

Remember: Higher scores = BETTER for Sentinel's swing trading mission.
```

## For Non-AI Departments (Compliance, Trading)

**Compliance Department**: Hard-code understanding that:
- Risk scores reflect swing trading suitability (NOT traditional safety)
- High scores = good momentum setups (NOT low-risk bonds)
- Low scores = either too boring OR too risky (NOT moderate positions)
- Warnings are advisory (NOT rejections)

**Trading Department**: Mechanical execution of approved plans
- No interpretation of risk scores needed
- Execute orders as specified by Portfolio Department
