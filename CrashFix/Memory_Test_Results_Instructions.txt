=== Windows Memory Diagnostic - Results Instructions ===
Test Scheduled: 2025-11-01 11:11:12
Computer: LAPTOP-1FV3ILC1

WHAT YOU JUST DID:
==================
You scheduled a Windows Memory Diagnostic test that will run when you restart.

WHAT HAPPENS DURING RESTART:
=============================
1. Computer restarts
2. Blue screen appears showing "Windows Memory Diagnostic"
3. Progress bar shows test status
4. Two passes: Basic (quick) and Standard (thorough)
5. Computer boots to Windows automatically when done
6. Results are logged in Event Viewer

TEST DURATION:
==============
Approximately 5-20 minutes (depends on RAM size and test thoroughness)

During the test, you'll see:
  - Current test pass (Pass 1 of 2, Pass 2 of 2)
  - Overall status
  - Cache tests, various pattern tests
  - DO NOT interrupt the test - let it complete

HOW TO CHECK RESULTS AFTER RESTART:
====================================

METHOD 1: Automatic Popup (Sometimes)
--------------------------------------
Windows may show a notification with results when you log in.

METHOD 2: Event Viewer (Most Reliable)
---------------------------------------
1. Press Windows Key + R
2. Type: eventvwr.msc
3. Press Enter
4. Navigate to: Windows Logs > System
5. Click "Find..." in right panel
6. Search for: MemoryDiagnostics-Results
7. Double-click the result to see details

METHOD 3: PowerShell (Quick)
-----------------------------
1. Open PowerShell as Administrator
2. Run this command:

   Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{LogName='System'; ProviderName='Microsoft-Windows-MemoryDiagnostics-Results'} -MaxEvents 1 | Format-List *

INTERPRETING RESULTS:
=====================

GOOD RESULT:
------------
"Windows Memory Diagnostic tested the computer's memory and detected no errors."
-> Your RAM is healthy!
-> Crashes are caused by something else (driver, software, etc.)

BAD RESULT:
-----------
"Windows Memory Diagnostic tested the computer's memory and detected hardware errors."
-> Your RAM is faulty and needs replacement
-> Contact ASUS support or computer technician
-> RAM is usually easy and inexpensive to replace

If Errors Found:
----------------
1. Note the specific error details
2. Run the test again to confirm (may be intermittent)
3. If errors persist, replace RAM
4. RAM errors cannot be fixed with software - hardware replacement required

WHAT TO DO NEXT:
================

If NO ERRORS (Good RAM):
------------------------
Continue troubleshooting:
  - Intel Graphics driver is most likely culprit (update first)
  - Power management settings (already optimized if you ran Fix_Power_Management.ps1)
  - Samsung NVMe driver (update via Samsung Magician)
  - Check Event Viewer for crash patterns

If ERRORS FOUND (Bad RAM):
---------------------------
1. Run test one more time to confirm
2. If errors persist, RAM needs replacement
3. Identify which module is faulty (if multiple modules)
4. Replace faulty RAM module
5. Computer should be stable after RAM replacement

PROBATION MONITORING NOTE:
==========================
The memory test runs BEFORE Windows loads, so your probation monitoring
software is not active during the test. It will resume normally when
Windows boots after the test completes. No interference will occur.

RUNNING THE TEST AGAIN:
========================
If you need to run the test again:
  1. Press Windows Key + R
  2. Type: mdsched.exe
  3. Click "Restart now and check for problems"

Or run this script (Run_Memory_Diagnostic.ps1) again.

NEED HELP?
==========
If you have trouble interpreting results or need assistance:
  - Check Event Viewer as described above
  - Screenshot the results
  - Contact computer technician if errors found
