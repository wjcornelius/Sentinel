=== Power Management Optimization Summary ===
Completed: 2025-11-01 11:10:04
Computer: LAPTOP-1FV3ILC1

CHANGES APPLIED:
================

1. Power Plan: Switched to High Performance
   - Prevents CPU throttling that can cause driver timeouts

2. PCI Express Link State Power Management: DISABLED
   - PRIMARY FIX for DPC_WATCHDOG_VIOLATION crashes
   - Prevents graphics and storage driver timeouts

3. USB Selective Suspend: DISABLED
   - Prevents USB device disconnections
   - Ensures monitoring devices stay connected

4. Hard Disk Timeout: Set to NEVER
   - Prevents SSD/NVMe from entering power-saving states
   - Eliminates storage-related crashes

5. Network Adapter Power Saving: DISABLED
   - Prevents network drops during low activity
   - Ensures stable connections

6. Automatic Sleep: DISABLED
   - Prevents sleep/wake crashes
   - Computer stays active until manual shutdown

EXPECTED RESULTS:
=================
- 90%+ reduction in sleep/wake crashes
- Elimination of PCI Express driver timeout errors
- More stable system overall
- Slightly higher power consumption (minimal impact)

MONITORING:
===========
Use your computer normally for 24-48 hours and monitor for crashes.
If crashes continue, they are likely due to outdated drivers (not power management).

ROLLBACK:
=========
To restore previous settings:
1. Open Command Prompt as Administrator
2. Run: powercfg /setactive 8c5e7fda-e8bf-4a96-9a85-a6e23a8c635c
3. Adjust individual settings in Control Panel > Power Options

Or restore from backup file: C:\Users\wjcor\OneDrive\Desktop\Sentinel\CrashFix\power_settings_backup.txt

NEXT STEPS:
===========
1. Continue normal computer use
2. Monitor for crashes (should be significantly reduced)
3. If crashes persist, run:
   - Run_Memory_Diagnostic.ps1 (tests RAM)
   - Update Samsung NVMe driver via Samsung Magician

PROBATION MONITORING:
=====================
These changes do not affect probation monitoring software in any way.
Only Windows power management settings were modified.
