PART 1: WHAT RAM TO ORDER FROM AMAZON
================================================================================

OPTION 1: REPLACE FAULTY 8GB (Keep 8GB Total) - $20-30
---------------------------------------------------------
Search Amazon for: "8GB DDR4 3200MHz SO-DIMM laptop RAM"

Recommended brands (in order of preference):
1. Crucial 8GB DDR4 3200 MT/s CL22 SODIMM 260-Pin Memory - CT8G4SFRA32A
   - Price: ~$20-25
   - Most reliable brand
   - Lifetime warranty

2. Kingston ValueRAM 8GB DDR4 3200MHz SODIMM - KVR32S22S8/8
   - Price: ~$22-28
   - Excellent compatibility
   - Lifetime warranty

3. Samsung 8GB DDR4 3200MHz SODIMM (if you want to stay with Samsung)
   - Part: M471A1K43DB1-CWE or similar
   - Price: ~$25-30

IMPORTANT: Make sure it says:
- DDR4 (NOT DDR5 or DDR3)
- 3200MHz (or PC4-25600)
- SO-DIMM or SODIMM (laptop memory, NOT desktop DIMM)
- 260-pin


OPTION 2: UPGRADE TO 16GB (RECOMMENDED) - $40-60
---------------------------------------------------------
Your laptop supports up to 16GB total. You have ONE RAM slot currently occupied.

**IMPORTANT CHECK**: Some Vivobook Go E1504GA models have:
- 1 slot (4GB or 8GB soldered + 1 slot for upgrade)
- 2 slots (both upgradeable)

Your system shows 8GB in "BANK 0" which suggests it's upgradeable.

To check if you can add a second stick:
1. Open the bottom panel (see instructions below)
2. Count the RAM slots
   - If you see 1 stick and 1 empty slot: You can ADD 8GB for 16GB total
   - If you see 1 stick only (no empty slot): You must REPLACE with 16GB

For 16GB upgrade, search Amazon for: "16GB DDR4 3200MHz SO-DIMM laptop RAM"

Recommended:
1. Crucial 16GB DDR4 3200 MT/s CL22 SODIMM - CT16G4SFRA32A
   - Price: ~$40-50
   - Replaces your faulty 8GB with healthy 16GB

2. Kingston ValueRAM 16GB DDR4 3200MHz SODIMM - KVR32S22D8/16
   - Price: ~$45-55


OPTION 3: ADD 8GB for 16GB Total (If 2 slots available) - $20-30
---------------------------------------------------------
If your laptop has 2 RAM slots and one is empty:
- Remove the faulty 8GB from BANK 0
- Install a NEW 8GB stick in BANK 0
- Keep using your computer
- If it's stable, your old stick was the problem
- Later, you can add another 8GB in the empty slot for 16GB total

================================================================================

TOOLS NEEDED:
- Phillips head screwdriver (small, #0 or #1)
- Plastic pry tool or old credit card (optional, for opening case)
- Clean, static-free workspace

SAFETY:
- Turn off laptop completely (not sleep)
- Unplug power adapter
- Remove battery if removable (yours is likely internal)
- Touch metal to discharge static before handling RAM

STEPS (TYPICAL FOR ASUS VIVOBOOK):
---------------------------------------------------------

1. PREPARE
   - Shut down laptop completely
   - Unplug power
   - Place laptop face-down on soft surface (towel/cloth)

2. REMOVE BOTTOM PANEL
   - Locate screws on bottom (usually 8-12 Phillips screws)
   - **IMPORTANT**: Some screws may be under rubber feet - peel them up gently
   - Remove all visible screws
   - Carefully pry open bottom panel starting from a corner
   - Use plastic tool or credit card, not metal screwdriver
   - Work your way around the edges
   - Lift off bottom panel

3. LOCATE RAM
   - RAM slot is usually near center or side of motherboard
   - Look for a small rectangular module with metal contacts
   - It's held by metal clips on each side

4. REMOVE OLD (FAULTY) RAM
   - Gently push the metal clips OUTWARD (away from RAM)
   - RAM will pop up at 45-degree angle
   - Carefully pull RAM stick straight out
   - **DO NOT touch the gold contacts**

5. INSTALL NEW RAM
   - Hold new RAM stick by the edges (avoid touching gold contacts)
   - Line up the notch in the RAM with the notch in the slot
   - Insert RAM at 45-degree angle
   - Press down firmly until it clicks into place
   - Metal clips should snap inward to hold it

6. REASSEMBLE
   - Replace bottom panel
   - Replace all screws (keep track of which screws go where!)
   - Replace rubber feet if you removed them

7. TEST
   - Plug in power
   - Turn on laptop
   - Laptop should boot normally
   - Windows should recognize new RAM automatically

8. VERIFY IN WINDOWS
   - Press Windows Key + Pause/Break
   - Or: Settings > System > About
   - Check "Installed RAM" shows correct amount (8GB or 16GB)

================================================================================
PART 5: TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

IF LAPTOP DOESN'T BOOT AFTER RAM REPLACEMENT:
---------------------------------------------------------

1. No power, no lights:
   - Turn off, remove RAM, reseat it firmly
   - Make sure RAM clicked into place
   - Check RAM is correct type (DDR4 SO-DIMM)

2. Beeps when turning on:
   - RAM not seated properly
   - Remove and reinstall, press down harder until CLICK

3. Windows shows wrong RAM amount:
   - RAM not fully inserted
   - Re-check installation

4. Computer still crashes after RAM replacement:
   - If using 2 sticks, one might still be bad
   - Test each stick individually
   - Or: You may have other hardware issues (unlikely based on memory test)

================================================================================
PART 6: IDENTIFYING THE FAULTY STICK (If you have 2 sticks)
================================================================================

If your laptop has 2 RAM slots with 2 sticks:

1. Open laptop, remove BOTH RAM sticks
2. Install stick #1 in BANK 0
3. Close laptop, use normally for a day
4. If it crashes: Stick #1 is bad
5. If stable: Remove stick #1, install stick #2
6. Use for a day
7. If it crashes: Stick #2 is bad

Since your system shows only BANK 0 with 8GB, you likely have just one stick,
which the memory test confirmed is faulty.

================================================================================
PART 7: WHAT TO DO WITH OLD RAM
================================================================================

Your old Samsung RAM stick (M471A1G44BB0-CWE) has MEMORY ERRORS.

DO NOT:
- Use it in another computer (will cause crashes there too)
- Sell it or give it away (it's defective)

DO:
- Keep it as a backup temporarily (in case new RAM is also defective - unlikely)
- Recycle it at electronics recycling center after verifying new RAM works
- Some computer stores accept defective RAM for recycling

================================================================================
PART 8: AFTER REPLACEMENT - VERIFY SUCCESS
================================================================================

After installing new RAM:

1. Boot into Windows
2. Run our diagnostic again:
   - Open PowerShell as Administrator
   - Run: C:\Users\wjcor\OneDrive\Desktop\Sentinel\CrashFix\Quick_Diagnostic.ps1
   - Should show: "No crashes found in last 7 days!" (after a few days)

3. Run Windows Memory Diagnostic again:
   - Press Windows Key + R
   - Type: mdsched.exe
   - Choose "Restart now and check for problems"
   - Let it complete (5-20 minutes)
   - After restart, check Event Viewer for results
   - Should show: "No errors detected"

4. Use computer normally for 3-7 days
   - If no crashes: SUCCESS! Problem solved!
   - If crashes continue: Contact me, may be other hardware issue (rare)
