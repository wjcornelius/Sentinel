# Week 6 Day 3 COMPLETE ✅
**SystemMonitor Class - Department Health & Latency Analysis**

## Summary
Built the SystemMonitor class that monitors system health across all 5 departments, tracks message latency, and detects processing bottlenecks. Includes graceful handling of uninitialized departments and placeholder latency data for Week 7 enhancement.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `executive_department.py`
- **Lines Added:** ~217 lines (SystemMonitor class)
- **Total Size:** ~920 lines
- **Status:** ✅ 3 of 4 CLASSES COMPLETE

**Class: SystemMonitor (Lines 566-780)**
- `__init__()` - Initialize with database and message directory paths
- `check_department_health()` - Query last activity from each department's table
- `_determine_health()` - Convert timestamp to health status (healthy/degraded/unhealthy/no_data)
- `analyze_message_latency()` - Track message flow timing (placeholder for Week 7)
- `detect_processing_bottlenecks()` - Identify departments with health or latency issues

### 2. Bug Fixes Applied
- **Fixed table name:** Changed `research_candidates` → `research_market_briefings`
- **Fixed database path:** Changed relative path `../../sentinel.db` → absolute path using `Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent`
- **Added error handling:** Wrapped each department check in try-except to handle missing tables gracefully

## Test Results

### Test 8: Check Department Health ✅
**Status by Department:**
- **Research:** no_data (table not initialized - research_market_briefings)
- **Risk:** healthy (active within last hour)
- **Portfolio:** healthy (active within last hour)
- **Compliance:** no_data (no activity recorded)
- **Trading:** no_data (table not initialized - trading_orders)

**Health Status Logic:**
- `<1 hour`: healthy
- `1-24 hours`: healthy
- `24-72 hours`: degraded
- `>72 hours`: unhealthy
- `no activity`: no_data
- `table missing`: no_data (graceful handling)

### Test 9: Analyze Message Latency ✅
**Placeholder Latency Metrics (5 Flows):**
1. **research_to_risk:** 12.5s avg, 45.0s max, 30.0s p95
2. **risk_to_portfolio:** 8.3s avg, 30.0s max, 20.0s p95
3. **portfolio_to_compliance:** 2.1s avg, 5.0s max, 4.0s p95
4. **compliance_to_portfolio:** 1.5s avg, 3.0s max, 2.0s p95
5. **portfolio_to_trading:** 5.2s avg, 15.0s max, 10.0s p95

**Note:** Real implementation in Week 7 will parse actual message timestamps from `Messages/` directory.

### Test 10: Detect Processing Bottlenecks ✅
**Detected Issues:**
- ⚠️ WARNING: `research_to_risk` latency elevated (12.5s avg)

**Detection Logic:**
1. Department health = unhealthy or degraded
2. Message latency >10s average

## Code Quality Metrics

### Patterns Followed:
- ✅ Error handling: Try-except for each department check
- ✅ Graceful degradation: Returns 'no_data' instead of crashing on missing tables
- ✅ Logging: INFO level for all major operations
- ✅ Health thresholds: Clear time-based health categories
- ✅ Placeholder pattern: Clear "NOTE:" comments for Week 7 enhancements
- ✅ Type hints: All method signatures include return types

### Method Responsibilities:
1. **check_department_health()** (40 lines)
   - Loop through 5 department tables
   - Query MAX(created_at) for each
   - Handle OperationalError for missing tables
   - Return health status dict

2. **_determine_health()** (50 lines)
   - Parse ISO timestamp
   - Calculate age in hours
   - Map to health status categories
   - Return structured health info

3. **analyze_message_latency()** (40 lines)
   - Placeholder: Return hardcoded latency metrics
   - Week 7: Will parse YAML frontmatter from message files
   - Track 5 inter-department message flows

4. **detect_processing_bottlenecks()** (30 lines)
   - Call check_department_health()
   - Call analyze_message_latency()
   - Identify unhealthy departments
   - Identify slow message flows (>10s avg)
   - Return list of warning messages

## Statistics

### Week 6 Days 1-3 Complete:
- **Total Lines Written:** ~920 lines (executive_department.py)
- **Classes Complete:** 3/4 (PerformanceAnalyzer ✅, StrategyReviewer ✅, SystemMonitor ✅)
- **Database Tables Queried:** 5 department tables
- **Health Checks:** 5 departments monitored
- **Latency Flows:** 5 inter-department message paths tracked
- **Tests Passing:** 10/10 (all green)

### Progress:
- ✅ Day 1: PerformanceAnalyzer (4 performance metrics)
- ✅ Day 2: StrategyReviewer (3 strategy analysis methods)
- ✅ Day 3: SystemMonitor (3 monitoring methods) **← JUST COMPLETED**
- ⏳ Day 4: ExecutiveDepartment Orchestrator (next)
- ⏳ Day 5: Integration Tests

## Integration Points

### 1. Database Monitoring
- **Tables Monitored:**
  - `research_market_briefings` (Research Department)
  - `risk_assessments` (Risk Department)
  - `portfolio_positions` (Portfolio Department)
  - `compliance_trade_validations` (Compliance Department)
  - `trading_orders` (Trading Department)
- **Status:** ✅ WORKING (graceful handling of missing tables)

### 2. Message Latency Tracking
- **Message Flows:**
  - Research → Risk (candidate evaluation)
  - Risk → Portfolio (approved positions)
  - Portfolio → Compliance (trade validation)
  - Compliance → Portfolio (approval/rejection)
  - Portfolio → Trading (trade execution)
- **Status:** ⏳ PLACEHOLDER (Week 7 will implement real parsing)

### 3. Bottleneck Detection
- **Detection Rules:**
  - Health-based: Department unhealthy or degraded
  - Latency-based: Message flow >10s average
- **Status:** ✅ WORKING (using placeholder data)

## Next Steps: Week 6 Day 4

1. `generate_daily_executive_summary()` - Comprehensive markdown report
   - Performance metrics (from PerformanceAnalyzer)
   - Strategy review (from StrategyReviewer)
   - System health (from SystemMonitor)
   - Top winners/losers
   - Risk alerts

2. `generate_weekly_strategy_review()` - Strategic analysis
   - 5-day performance trends
   - Sector rotation analysis
   - Win rate by sector
   - Recommendations for next week

3. `get_realtime_dashboard_data()` - JSON API for dashboard
