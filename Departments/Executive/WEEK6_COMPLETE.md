# WEEK 6 COMPLETE ✅
**Executive Department - Performance Monitoring & Strategic Oversight**

## Overview
Built the complete Executive Department for Sentinel Corporation, providing real-time performance monitoring, strategic analysis, system health oversight, and comprehensive executive reporting. The department aggregates data from all other departments and generates actionable insights for decision-making.

## Architecture

   - Sharpe ratio (risk-adjusted returns)
   - Win rate analysis
   - Maximum drawdown tracking

2. **StrategyReviewer** - Strategic analysis and benchmarking
   - Sector performance analysis
   - Best/worst trade identification
   - Benchmark comparison (vs SPY/QQQ)

3. **SystemMonitor** - System health and latency monitoring
   - Department health status (5 departments)
   - Message latency analysis (5 flows)
   - Bottleneck detection

4. **ExecutiveDepartment** - Main orchestrator
   - Daily executive summary reports (Markdown + JSON)
   - Real-time dashboard API
   - Integration with all sub-components
