# Week 7 Day 5 COMPLETE ‚úÖ
**End-to-End Integration Testing & Manual Operation Mode**

## Summary
Successfully completed comprehensive end-to-end testing of Sentinel Corporation with **90.9% success rate** (30/33 tests passing). The system is operational and ready for manual use. Automated scheduling was **intentionally skipped** due to computer stability concerns and probation monitoring requirements.

## Key Decisions

### ‚úÖ Manual Operation Mode (Not Automated)
**Rationale:** Given your situation:
- Computer crashes frequently
- Sleep mode required (shared home, probation monitoring)
- System must only run when you're present and in control

**Solution:** Simple desktop shortcuts for on-demand operation

2. **Automated Scheduling** - Daily emails, hourly alerts
3. **24/7 Monitoring** - Always-on dashboard
4. **Auto-trading** - Fully automated execution

**Recommendation:** Stick with manual operation until you have:
- Stable computer OR dedicated server
- No probation monitoring concerns
- Comfortable leaving system running unattended

## Known Limitations

### Computer Stability:
- **Issue:** Computer crashes often
- **Impact:** Can't rely on automated scheduling
- **Solution:** Manual operation mode

### Sleep Mode:
- **Issue:** Computer goes to sleep (required for shared home)
- **Impact:** Would interrupt automated tasks
- **Solution:** Run tasks only when you're present

### Probation Monitoring:
- **Issue:** Computer monitored, must be responsible for all activity
- **Impact:** Can't leave unattended processes running
- **Solution:** Manual control, run on-demand only
