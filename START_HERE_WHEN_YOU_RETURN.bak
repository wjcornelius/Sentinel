  START HERE: A Message to My Future, Clueless Self
==================================================================

Hello, Future Me.

You've been away from Project Sentinel for a while and have likely forgotten the details. That is completely expected and okay. This file is your time capsule.

Follow these steps EXACTLY to get the project running and to bring a new AI assistant up to speed so you can continue development. Do not skip any steps.

------------------------------------------------------------------
  STEP 1: PREPARE YOUR SOFTWARE
------------------------------------------------------------------

You will need three pieces of software. Make sure they are installed.

1.  A Code Editor: **NoteTab Lite** (or similar). This is for looking at the code files.
2.  A Database Viewer: **DB Browser for SQLite**. This is to look at the bot's performance history, which is stored in the `sentinel.db` file.
3.  An AI Chat Interface: The program you are using to talk to the AI (like Poe, ChatGPT, etc.).

------------------------------------------------------------------
  STEP 2: PREPARE THE PROJECT ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------

You need to reactivate the Python environment for this project.

1.  Open the Command Prompt.
2.  Navigate to the project folder by typing:
    cd C:\Users\wjcor\OneDrive\Desktop\Sentinel
3.  Activate the virtual environment by typing:
    venv\Scripts\activate
    (Your prompt should now start with `(venv)`)
4.  Ensure all libraries are up to date by typing:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

The project is now technically ready to run.

------------------------------------------------------------------
  STEP 3: PREPARE THE "FIRST PROMPT" FOR THE AI
------------------------------------------------------------------

Your main job is to give the new AI the correct starting information. This is called "providing context." We will do this with a single, large "First Prompt."

1.  Open a new, clean chat with the AI you will be using.
2.  Copy the entire template from the box below and paste it into the AI chat box. DO NOT SEND IT YET.

    ---[START OF TEMPLATE FOR AI]---
    Hello. We are restarting development on a project called "Sentinel," an AI-driven stock trading bot. Your role is to act as my lead developer and partner.

    To bring you up to speed, I am providing the three essential "Pillars of Knowledge" for this project. Please read and confirm you understand them.

    I also have the full performance database (`sentinel.db`) and our complete prior conversation history (`Project Sentinel - Conversation History.txt`) available locally. I will act as your "Context Manager," providing you with specific information from these large files when you ask for it.

    Our first goal today is: [**TYPE YOUR GOAL FOR TODAY HERE. For example: "Analyze the first month of trading performance." or "Fix a bug I noticed."**]

    Here are the three pillars:

    ### PILLAR 1: The README File (High-Level Overview)
    ```
    [PASTE THE ENTIRE CONTENTS of README.md HERE]
    ```

    ### PILLAR 2: The DESIGN_LOG File (Key Decisions & Changes)
    ```
    [PASTE THE ENTIRE CONTENTS of DESIGN_LOG.md HERE]
    ```

    ### PILLAR 3: The Main Script (Current Code)
    ```python
    [PASTE THE ENTIRE CONTENTS of main_script.py HERE]
    ```

    Please review all three pillars and then confirm you are ready to help me achieve our first goal.
    ---[END OF TEMPLATE FOR AI]---

3.  Now, fill in the placeholders in the template you just pasted:
    *   For `[PASTE THE ENTIRE CONTENTS of README.md HERE]`:
        *   Open `README.md` in NoteTab Lite.
        *   Press `Ctrl+A` to select all text.
        *   Press `Ctrl+C` to copy it.
        *   Go back to the AI chat, select the placeholder text, and press `Ctrl+V` to paste.
    *   Do the exact same thing for `DESIGN_LOG.md` and `main_script.py`.
    *   Finally, decide on a simple goal for your first day back and type it in the `[**TYPE YOUR GOAL...**]` section.

4.  Once all placeholders are filled, send this massive "First Prompt" to the AI. The AI is now up to speed.

------------------------------------------------------------------
  STEP 4: REMEMBER YOUR ROLE
------------------------------------------------------------------

The AI's memory (context window) is small. You cannot give it the entire database or conversation history. Your job is to be the "librarian."

*   If the AI asks, "How did the trades in NVDA perform?" -> Use **DB Browser for SQLite** to open `sentinel.db`, find the answer, and give the AI a short summary.
*   If the AI asks, "Why did we decide to use the Nasdaq 100?" -> Open the **`Project Sentinel - Conversation History.txt`** file, search for "Nasdaq", find the relevant paragraph, and paste it to the AI.

That's it. You are now ready to continue the project.
