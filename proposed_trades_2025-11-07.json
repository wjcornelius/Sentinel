  "gpt5_reasoning": "Given the current market conditions and the portfolio state, we are tasked with both freeing up capital and maintaining an efficient, diversified portfolio. The primary focus will be on maximizing capital deployment while adhering to our swing trading principles and allocation guidelines. The market sentiment is neutral, and VIX is at 20, indicating some caution but also allowing for proactive positions in volatile stocks.\n\n### Current Holdings Analysis:\n1. **SELL Decisions:**\n   - **BKR**: The technical score is just at the threshold of holdworthiness at 55, but the fundamental score of 54 suggests underperformance. Additionally, the unrealized P&L is negligible. It's advisable to sell.\n   - **COP**: With a technical score of 60 and a fundamental score of 58, it presents moderate technicals but poor fundamentals. With a negligible sentiment score better opportunities await.\n   - **UBER**: The technical score of 60 and an overall sentiment of 50 suggest lukewarm performance. The fundamental score of 69 is decent but not compelling enough in this market condition.\n\n2. **HOLD Decisions (Implicit):**\n   - Positions with high technical scores such as QCOM, WFC, and APH should continue to be held due to their strong potential for an upward swing.\n\n### New Buy Candidates Analysis:\nTo achieve optimal portfolio diversification and capitalize on potential opportunities, we prioritize candidates with high composite scores, aligning with strong technical and fundamental scores.\n\n1. **MNST (Composite Score: 73.0):** Strong fundamentals paired with positive sentiment make MNST a considerable buy with a possible allocation around 6% to 7%.\n2. **APO (Composite Score: 69.0):** Shows strong technical support with a high sentiment boost which suggests momentum. Consider allocating around 6% of the portfolio.\n3. **AZN (Composite Score: 68.4):** The sentiment is notably high at 80, reflecting strong market confidence, ideal for a moderate allocation.\n4. **SLB (Composite Score: 67.0):** Excellent technicals and moderate sentiment provide a solid opportunity for sector diversification.\n5. **UPS (Composite Score: 66.8):** Although fundamental score is weaker, it stands strong on technicals and can be a quick opportunity for a swing trade.\n\n### Proposed Trading Plan:",
