Our holdings in CARR and ODFL are showing concerning indicators, particularly with their composite scores, which have deteriorated to below acceptable levels (<55). Therefore, we recommend selling these positions to free up capital for more potential opportunities. \n\nThe candidate list presents several attractive options, notably WFC and APH, both achieving composite scores above 75, indicating strong technical, fundamental, and sentiment alignment. Moreover, diversifying across sectors is imperative, and these candidates fit well into our strategy, offering potential for robust swing moves given their current metrics. We will allocate around 7%-10% of capital to WFC as a high-conviction stock and other moderate investments across the remaining top candidates to ensure we reach our goal of 20 positions while adhering to our risk management guidelines. The focus will also include sector diversification to spread risk effectively.\n\nTo ensure we remain within compliance rules and fully utilize our available capital, we will target a diversified approach across our selected new positions while closing the underperforming ones. With this approach, our deployment will exceed the 90% capital threshold adequately.\n\n### Proposed Trading Plan Output",
