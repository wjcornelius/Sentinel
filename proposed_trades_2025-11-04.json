Financials and energy screens are strongest across our candidates; we\u2019ll add two top-tier banks (WFC, CFG) and a high-momentum gas E&P (EQT), then diversify with UBER (growth/transport-tech), EIX (defensive utility with strong sentiment), and CTVA (agri-inputs).\n\nWe will close four underperformers (CCL, HPQ, FITB, GLW) and top up our best current leaders (IBKR, COP, ODFL, CARR) toward the 10% cap to increase capital efficiency. This plan deploys approximately 83% of freed capital today; given the 10% cap and score-based sizing on sub-65 composites, we\u2019ll retain some dry powder to add on pullbacks or new signals within the next 1\u20133 sessions.
