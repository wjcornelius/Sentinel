## Test Results Detailed

### ‚úÖ Test 1: PDT Compliance Search
**Status**: PASS
**Duration**: 5 minutes
**Result**: EXCELLENT NEWS - Alpaca API tracks PDT automatically!

**Findings**:
- `account.daytrade_count`: 0 (no recent day trades)
- `account.pattern_day_trader`: False
- `account.trading_blocked`: False
- `account.account_blocked`: False

**Recommendation**: Add explicit check in workflow to query daytrade_count before submitting orders, but Alpaca provides built-in protection.

**Risk Assessment**: CRITICAL risk ‚Üí LOW risk ‚úÖ

---

### ‚úÖ Test 2: Database Migration

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Result**: Working perfectly for standalone calls

**Test Data**:
- **NVDA News**: 1,352 chars, 2 sources, sentiment: positive
- **Market Overview**: 1,615 chars, 6 citations

**Performance**: Fast (~5-10 seconds per query)

---

### ‚úÖ Test 4: Conviction Weighting Formula
**Status**: PASS - **BUG FIX CONFIRMED!**
**Duration**: 3 minutes
**Result**: High conviction scores get significantly more capital

**Test Scores**:
| Score | Normalized | Weight | Capital Multiplier |
|-------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| 100   | 1.00       | 1.0000 | 4.00x vs score 50 |
| 95    | 0.95       | 0.9025 | 3.61x vs score 50 |
| 85    | 0.85       | 0.7225 | 2.89x vs score 50 |
| 75    | 0.75       | 0.5625 | 2.25x vs score 50 |
| 70    | 0.70       | 0.4900 | 1.96x vs score 50 |
| 65    | 0.65       | 0.4225 | 1.69x vs score 50 |
| 50    | 0.50       | 0.2500 | 1.00x (baseline)  |
| 25    | 0.25       | 0.0625 | 0.25x vs score 50 |
| 10    | 0.10       | 0.0500 | 0.20x (min floor) |
| 1     | 0.01       | 0.0500 | 0.20x (min floor) |

**Key Findings**:
- ‚úÖ Monotonic weighting (higher score = more weight)
- ‚úÖ Score 100 gets **4x more capital** than score 50
- ‚úÖ Score 95 gets **1.60x more** than score 75
- ‚úÖ MIN_WEIGHT_FLOOR working (prevents zero allocation)

**Before Bug Fix**: All scores ‚â•10 got weight 1.0 (broken!)
**After Bug Fix**: Proper differentiation across full 1-100 range

**Status**: üéâ **CRITICAL BUG FIX VALIDATED**

### ‚úÖ Test 5: Database Operations
**Status**: PASS
**Duration**: 3 minutes
**Result**: All CRUD operations working

**Operations Tested**:
1. **INSERT**: ‚úÖ Test record inserted successfully
2. **SELECT**: ‚úÖ Record retrieved correctly
3. **UPDATE**: ‚úÖ Simulated order fill (status, filled_price, filled_qty)
4. **DELETE**: ‚úÖ Test data cleaned up

**Test Data**:
```python
{
    'symbol': 'TEST_SYMBOL',
    'order_id': 'test_order_20251027_214500',
    'qty': 100,
    'conviction_score': 85,
    'reasoning': 'Test reasoning for conviction-based sell',
    'tier3_decision': 'SELL',
    'status': 'pending' ‚Üí 'filled'
}
```

**No Errors**: All operations completed without exceptions

---

### ‚úÖ Test 6: Workflow Import Fix
**Status**: PASS
**Duration**: 5 minutes
**Result**: Missing `SEND_EMAIL_ON_ERRORS` constant added

**Issue**: Workflow tried to import `SEND_EMAIL_ON_ERRORS` from `risk_config.py` but it didn't exist

**Fix**: Added line to `sentinel/risk_config.py`:
```python
SEND_EMAIL_ON_ERRORS = True       # Email on system errors
```

**Verification**: Workflow now imports without errors ‚úÖ

---

- Could not test SELL/BUY execution logic

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL PASS (edge case found)

---

## Edge Case Found: API Connection Errors

### Issue Description
When Perplexity API closes connection unexpectedly, the workflow crashes instead of:
1. Logging the error
2. Continuing with remaining tickers (skip the failed one)
3. Completing the workflow

### Recommended Fix
Add try/except in Perplexity batch news gathering:

```python
# In sentinel/tier3_conviction_analysis.py or perplexity_news.py

for symbol in symbols:
    try:
        news_data[symbol] = perplexity.gather_ticker_news(symbol)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning(f"Could not fetch news for {symbol}: {e}")
        # Use empty/generic news for this ticker
        news_data[symbol] = {
            'symbol': symbol,
            'news_summary': 'Recent news unavailable',
            'sentiment': 'neutral',
            'success': False,
            'error': str(e)
        }
        # Continue with next ticker
        continue
```

### Priority: MEDIUM
- Not blocking for go-live (rare occurrence)
- Should fix before production use
- Estimated fix time: 15 minutes

2. **Conviction Weighting**: Fixed (divide by 100 not 10)

### New Features ‚úÖ
1. **Perplexity Integration**: Working (standalone and in workflow)
2. **Market Context**: Real-time market overview fetched successfully
3. **Hierarchical Context**: 9 sector contexts built correctly
4. **Tier 1 Filter**: 75 stocks ‚Üí 60 candidates (80% pass rate)

6. **News Gathering**: 18/60 tickers successfully fetched before error

### Infrastructure ‚úÖ
1. **Database**: conviction_sells table ready
2. **Existing Positions**: 53 positions managed (stops updated)
3. **Imports**: All dependencies resolved
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logs generated

---

## What We Could NOT Test (Due to API Error)

### Step 6A: SELL Signal Execution
- ‚ùå Could not verify SELL signals generate correctly from Tier 3
- ‚ùå Could not test SELL execution logic
- ‚ùå Could not verify conviction_sells table insertion

### Step 6B: BUY Signal Execution
- ‚ùå Could not verify BUY filtering threshold (70/100)
- ‚ùå Could not test conviction-weighted position sizing in practice
- ‚ùå Could not verify SELL-then-BUY cash sequencing

### Step 7: Summary Report
- ‚ùå Could not test summary generation
- ‚ùå Could not verify final statistics

**Impact**: Need one more dry-run after fixing error handling
