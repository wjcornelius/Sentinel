# PROMPT FOR CLAUDE (POE)

**From:** WJC
**To:** Claude (PoE)

**Re:** Review CC's Understanding of Our Revolutionary Architecture

---

## CONTEXT

Today we built something revolutionary - over 200K tokens of institutional architecture for Sentinel Corporation:

1. **Corporate Charter** (~15,000 words) - Six-department structure with message-based communication
2. **DEPARTMENTAL_SPECIFICATIONS** - Complete technical blueprint for all departments
3. **MESSAGE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION** - Communication backbone with risk/allocation/approval algorithms
4. **hard_constraints.yaml** - Automated risk governance
5. **PHASE_1_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN** - 8-10 week build sequence

CC (Claude Code) got confused about how to use our existing v6.2 codebase. I explained that I want him to:

**✅ BUILD FRESH** from today's revolutionary blueprint
**✅ USE EXISTING TOOLS** (venv, API keys, database patterns)
**✅ REMEMBER V6.2 LESSONS** (what worked, what didn't)
**❌ DON'T COPY V6.2 CODE** (no adaptation, no Frankenstein)

**The Analogy:** Like rebuilding after prison - keep your memories and skills, use available tools, build a new life, but don't drag broken possessions. Like Musk's Tesla - learn from 100 years of cars, but build something revolutionary.

## YOUR TASK

CC has saved your technical review here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wjcornelius/Sentinel/main/Messages_From_Claude_Poe/2025-10-31_CP_Technical_Review_V6.2_Reuse_Strategy.md

Please review CC's understanding and answer:

1. **Did CC get it right?** Does he understand he should build fresh from TODAY'S 200K+ token blueprint, not adapt v6.2 code?

2. **Is the synthesis correct?** Three parts:
   - Build from today's documents (Corporate Charter, DEPARTMENTAL_SPECIFICATIONS, MESSAGE_PROTOCOL)
   - Use existing tools (venv, config.py, database patterns, stock lists)
   - Remember v6.2 lessons (Alpaca patterns, stop formulas) but don't copy code

3. **Is the 8-10 week timeline realistic** for building fresh from today's blueprint?

4. **Did CC properly celebrate today's revolutionary work?** The Corporate Charter, the 200K+ master spec, the message protocol - this is genuinely NEW institutional thinking, not v6.2 adapted.

5. **What should CC focus on in Week 1** (Trading Department) to demonstrate he's building from today's blueprint, not adapting v6.2?

## DELIVERABLE

Your assessment for me on whether CC now understands the vision:

- **Build the Tesla** (revolutionary new architecture from today)
- **Not modify the Model T** (don't adapt v6.2 code)
- **But remember 100 years of automotive lessons** (v6.2 taught us what works)
- **And use the tools in the garage** (venv, API keys, existing infrastructure)

Is CC ready to proceed with Week 1?
