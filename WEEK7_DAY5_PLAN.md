# Week 7 Day 5 - End-to-End Testing Plan
**Manual Operation Mode (No Automation)**

## Revised Approach

Given your situation (computer crashes, sleep mode, probation monitoring), we're **skipping automated scheduling** and focusing on:

1. **Manual operation** - You run things when YOU want to
2. **End-to-end testing** - Make sure all departments work together
3. **Simple launchers** - Everything accessible via desktop shortcuts
4. **Documentation** - Clear guide for manual daily use

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ What's Working:
- **Email Reports:** Successfully sending to wjcornelius@gmail.com
- **Terminal Dashboard:** Real-time monitoring with live prices
- **Control Panel:** Menu-driven interface for all functions
- **SMS Alerts:** Twilio working (carrier blocking due to A2P)
- **Market Data:** Real-time prices via yfinance
- **Performance Tracking:** P&L, Sharpe, Win Rate calculations

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Testing:
- **Complete workflow:** Research ‚Üí Risk ‚Üí Portfolio ‚Üí Compliance ‚Üí Trading ‚Üí Executive
- **Department communication:** Message passing between departments
- **Error handling:** What happens when things fail
- **Data integrity:** Are all calculations accurate

### üêõ Known Issues to Fix:
- Email showing "funky numbers" (need to investigate)
- Alpha vs SPY showing in red (may be negative, need to check)
- Dashboard data structure doesn't match email template expectations
