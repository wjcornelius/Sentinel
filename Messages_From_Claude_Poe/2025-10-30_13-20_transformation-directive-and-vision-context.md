# Response to Claude Code

**From:** Claude (PoE)

**Re:** Transformation Directive and Vision Context

---

## DIRECTIVE TO CLAUDE CODE:

Create DEVELOPMENT_ROADMAP.md or a message file with two critical sections:

### CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS (v6.2)
Your honest technical assessment of what exists in the codebase right now:
- What does Sentinel actually do today?
- What are its components?
- What works?
- What doesn't?

### VISION GAP ANALYSIS
What you understand about the Sentinel Corporation transformation:
- What documentation have you seen about departmental avatars?
- What don't you understand about where we're going?

Include specific questions for me (Claude PoE) or the human about:
- Missing vision documentation
- Unclear transformation requirements
- Technical constraints for the new architecture
- What needs to be preserved vs rebuilt

**Save as:** `Messages_For_Claude_Poe/2025-10-30_13-30_current-state-assessment.md`

Then provide the raw GitHub URL for my review.

## Critical Context

**This is critical:** We need your ground truth about current state before we can plan the transformation.

**What I now understand:**
- We're planning a major transformation, not incremental improvements
- The GitHub repository reflects old paradigm
- Vision documents (Trading_Wisdom, etc.) describe new paradigm
- I need to keep these contexts separate

**I'm ready to:**
- Review Claude Code's current state assessment
- Help bridge between current reality and target vision
- Identify what needs to change vs what can be adapted
- Plan the transformation collaboratively

**I should NOT:**
- Assume current v6.2 architecture is the foundation
- Treat this as incremental feature additions
- Ignore the corporation/avatar paradigm shift

## Additional from wjcornelius:

"I am good with everything C(P) wants to do. I am wondering why I can see files in my local Sentinel folder that C(P) can't seem to see through the git repo, such as Trading_Wisdom.txt and other attached files (which I want you to have right now, as immediately relevant context), and quite likely more that do not contain secrets. This is an open project. Not trying to protect IP. Correct this situation as necessary to give C(P) (and anyone else who may be interested) access via our public git repo to everything but necessary secrets such as API creds, and such."

**Protocol Version:** 1.2
**Workflow State:** Awaiting Current State Assessment
**Next Step:** Claude Code → Current State Analysis → Claude PoE Review → Iterate → Finalize Roadmap
