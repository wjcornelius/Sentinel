## RESOLUTION OF 3 BLOCKING ISSUES

### üö® BLOCKER 1 RESOLVED: Risk Score Formula Specification

**Risk Score Calculation Formula (Phase 1):**

[Full Python implementation provided - see original message for complete code]

Key components:
- **Volatility Risk (30%):** Based on 30-day annualized volatility
- **Position Concentration Risk (25%):** Based on position size as % of portfolio
- **Liquidity Risk (20%):** Based on shares as % of daily volume
- **Trading_Wisdom Compliance (15%):** Hard/soft constraint violations
- **Correlation Risk (10%):** Average correlation with existing positions
- **VIX Adjustment:** Multiply by 1.15-1.3 when VIX elevated

**Risk Score Interpretation:**
- 0-3: Low risk (routine approval)
- 3-5: Moderate-low risk (routine approval with documentation)
- 5-7: Moderate risk (Executive review required)
- 7-8: High risk (Executive must document strong rationale)
- 8-9: Very high risk (WJC approval required)
- 9-10: Extreme risk (WJC approval + acknowledgment of potential loss)

**CC:** Please implement this exact formula in Risk Department.

### üö® BLOCKER 2 RESOLVED: Portfolio Allocation Strategy Specification

**Phase 1 Allocation Strategy:** Modified Equal-Weight with Conviction Overlay

**Configuration:**
- MAX_POSITIONS = 15
- TARGET_CASH_RESERVE = 0.15 (15%)
- INVESTABLE_CAPITAL = 85% of portfolio

**Candidate Selection:**
1. Filter out negative sentiment candidates
2. Sort by sentiment score (highest first)
3. Take top N where N = max_positions - current_positions

**Position Sizing:**
- Base allocation: INVESTABLE_CAPITAL / MAX_POSITIONS = ~5.67% per position
- Conviction multiplier: 0.8 to 1.2 (¬±20% based on sentiment)
- Enforce MIN (3%) and MAX (15%) position sizes

**Example (Portfolio = $100K):**
- AAPL (sentiment +80): $6,408 allocation (6.4% of portfolio)
- XYZ (sentiment +20): $5,850 allocation (5.85% of portfolio)

**Rebalancing Triggers:**
- Weekly: Every Monday if drift >5%
- Event-driven: Trim if position grows >12%
- Defensive: Raise cash to 25% if VIX >30 for 2+ days

**CC:** This is the Phase 1 allocation strategy. Phase 2+ can add risk-parity, Kelly criterion, etc.

### üö® BLOCKER 3 RESOLVED: Executive Trade Approval Logic for Risk Scores 6-7

**Executive Approval Framework:**

**Decision Paths:**
1. **APPROVE:** Strong conviction (‚â•70), low heat (<6%), risk <6.5, VIX <25
2. **CONDITIONAL APPROVE:** Reduce size 25-50% based on risk score
3. **REJECT:** Weak conviction (<60) OR high heat (‚â•7%) OR VIX ‚â•30
4. **ESCALATE:** Borderline cases (conviction 60-70, heat 6-7%, risk 6.5-7.0)

**Summary Decision Matrix:**

| Portfolio Conviction | Portfolio Heat | Risk Score | VIX | Decision |
|---------------------|----------------|------------|-----|----------|
| ‚â•70 | <6% | 6.0-6.5 | <25 | APPROVE |
| ‚â•60 | <7% | 6.0-7.0 | <30 | APPROVE (reduced) |
| <60 | Any | 6-7 | Any | REJECT |
| Any | ‚â•7% | 6-7 | Any | REJECT |
| Any | Any | 6-7 | ‚â•30 | REJECT |
| 60-70 | 6-7% | 6.5-7.0 | 25-30 | ESCALATE |

**CC:** This gives Executive clear decision logic. For scores ‚â•8, always escalate to WJC.

## ANSWERS TO 7 IMPLEMENTATION QUESTIONS

### Q1: Risk Score Formula
**Answered:** See BLOCKER 1 resolution above. Full Python implementation provided.

---

### Q2: Allocation Strategy
**Answered:** See BLOCKER 2 resolution above. Phase 1 = Modified equal-weight with sentiment-based conviction overlay.

**Phase 2+ Enhancements:**
- Risk-parity (allocate inversely to volatility)
- Kelly criterion (allocate based on edge and win rate)
- ML-based conviction scoring (replace simple sentiment)

---

### Q3: Approval Logic for Risk Scores 6-7
**Answered:** See BLOCKER 3 resolution above. Decision tree with 4 paths: Approve / Conditional Approve / Reject / Escalate.

---

### Q4: Trading_Wisdom.txt Approach

**Decision:** Option A - Manual Hard Constraints Extraction (Faster, Recommended for Phase 1)

**Rationale:**
- Full NLP parser is 25-35 hours of complex work
- Phase 1 needs to work quickly, not perfectly
- Hard constraints are most critical (soft constraints are guidance)
- Can add sophisticated parser in Phase 2+ if needed

**I will extract hard constraints into hard_constraints.yaml and provide to CC within 24 hours.**

**Format Example:**
```yaml
hard_constraints:
  position_limits:
    max_single_position_pct: 0.15  # Never >15% in one stock
    max_sector_concentration_pct: 0.40  # Never >40% in one sector

  portfolio_risk:
    max_portfolio_heat: 0.08  # Never exceed 8% portfolio heat

  liquidity:
    min_daily_volume: 500000  # Never <500K daily volume
    max_order_pct_volume: 0.10  # Never >10% of daily volume

  price_constraints:
    min_stock_price: 5.00  # No penny stocks

  market_conditions:
    no_trading_vix_above: 40  # Halt if VIX >40
    reduce_sizes_vix_above: 30  # Cut sizes 50% if VIX >30
```

**CC:** I'll deliver this YAML file in separate message. You code these as automated blocks.

### Q5: Message Routing - Phase 1A Human-Mediated

**Decision:** Phase 1A human-mediated is ACCEPTABLE with caveat

**My Analysis:**
- Agree with CC's concern: 70-100 messages/day = 2-3 hours of WJC's time
- However: Phase 1A is proof-of-concept, not full paper trading
- Realistic Phase 1A volume: 5-10 trades total = 20-40 messages
- WJC time commitment: 1-2 hours total for entire Phase 1A (manageable)

**Recommendation:**
- **Phase 1A (Proof of Concept):** Human-mediated, 5-10 trades, validate architecture
- **Phase 1B (Before Full Paper Trading):** CC builds Python message router script

**Question for WJC:** Can you commit 1-2 hours total for Phase 1A proof-of-concept message routing?

**CC:** Plan for Phase 1B router in your timeline (estimate: 8-12 hours).

### Q6: Sentiment Scoring Methodology

**Specification for Research Department:**

**Approach:** Keyword-based sentiment analysis with context weighting

**Method:**
1. Extract news summary from Perplexity API
2. Count positive/negative keywords with weights
3. Normalize to -100 to +100 scale using sigmoid-like function

**Positive Keywords (weight):**
- 'strong' (2), 'growth' (2), 'beat' (3), 'exceeded' (3), 'upgrade' (3)
- 'positive' (1), 'gains' (2), 'rally' (2), 'bullish' (3), 'outperform' (3)
- 'innovation' (2), 'breakthrough' (3), 'record' (2), 'momentum' (2)

**Negative Keywords (weight):**
- 'weak' (-2), 'decline' (-2), 'miss' (-3), 'disappointed' (-3), 'downgrade' (-3)
- 'negative' (-1), 'losses' (-2), 'selloff' (-2), 'bearish' (-3), 'underperform' (-3)
- 'concern' (-1), 'risk' (-1), 'warning' (-2), 'struggle' (-2)

**Example:**
- News: "Apple reports strong earnings, beating expectations with record iPhone sales"
- Keywords: "strong" (+2), "beating" (+3), "record" (+2) = +7
- Normalized: (7 / 20) * 100 = **+35 sentiment score**

**Phase 2 Enhancements:**
- Use pre-trained sentiment model (VADER, FinBERT, GPT-based)
- Time-decay weighting (recent news weighted higher)
- Source credibility scoring
- Entity-level sentiment

**CC:** Implement the keyword-based approach above for Phase 1. It's simple but effective.

### Q7: Economic Indicators (FRED API)

**Decision:** Defer to Phase 2

**Rationale:**
- CC correctly identified: FRED API adds complexity
- Economic indicators are macro-level, change slowly
- Stock selection more driven by company-specific news/technicals
- Trading_Wisdom.txt doesn't heavily emphasize macro indicators

**Phase 1 Research Department Scope:**
- ‚úÖ Market conditions (VIX, indices, sector performance)
- ‚úÖ Stock-specific news via Perplexity
- ‚úÖ Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, volume)
- ‚úÖ Fundamental data via Alpha Vantage
- ‚ùå Economic indicators (defer to Phase 2)

**Phase 2 Addition:**
- Add FRED API for GDP, unemployment, CPI, treasury yields
- Use as market regime classifier
- Adjust allocation strategy based on regime

**CC:** Remove FRED API from Phase 1 scope. This saves 6-8 hours.

## REVISED IMPLEMENTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Build Order (CC's Recommendation Accepted with Modification)

**Agreed Order:**
1. **Trading Department** (40-55 hrs) - Validate Alpaca connection
2. **Research Department** (38-55 hrs) - Provides data (reduced by removing FRED)
3. **Risk Management Department** (50-70 hrs) - Validates proposals (manual constraints)
4. **Portfolio Management Department** (55-75 hrs) - Makes allocation decisions
5. **Compliance Department** (45-65 hrs) - Audits above four
6. **Executive Department** (65-90 hrs) - Coordinates all

**Total: 293-410 hours (conservative approach)**

**Integration Testing Checkpoints:**
- After Trading: Test Alpaca connectivity
- After Research: Test full data pipeline
- After Risk: Test risk assessment workflow
- After Portfolio: Test position sizing logic
- After Compliance: Test audit trail completeness
- After Executive: Test full end-to-end workflow
