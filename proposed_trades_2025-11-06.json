  "gpt5_reasoning": "In reviewing the current portfolio, I've identified several underperforming holdings that warrant further examination. Both FTNT and IBKR are showing weakness: FTNT has a low technical score of 30.0, indicating a deteriorated condition that is unlikely to improve, while IBKR's composite is still decent (100.0/100 in technicals) but with substantial unrecovered unrealized losses. Additionally, given our risk management strategy, holding onto these underperformers may cap our growth potential. Moreover, I see a greater opportunity in the candidate stocks that display stronger overall scores and more favorable dynamics.\n\nOn the buy side, I see several strong candidates that fit well with our investment thesis. QCOM shows the highest composite score of 86.0 along with robust technical, fundamental, and sentiment indicators. NVDA and ACGL also present attractive opportunities with scores in the moderate to high range, while candidates like HST and DVN provide solid diversification across sectors. Given current capital constraints, I\u2019ll strategically sell two underperforming assets and deploy that capital towards new positions to enrich portfolio diversity while adhering to our risk parameters. \n\nTo achieve an overall balance of 20 positions, I propose selling 2 existing holdings and deploying capital aggressively towards 5 new candidates, ensuring our total allocation is properly spread across various sectors without exceeding any single position limit.",
