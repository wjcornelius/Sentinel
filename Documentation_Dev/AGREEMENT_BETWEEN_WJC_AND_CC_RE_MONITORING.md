# Agreement Between WJC and Claude Code Regarding Monitoring Software

**Date:** November 6, 2025, 9:40 AM Pacific Time
**Parties:** WJC (User) and Claude Code (AI Assistant)
**Subject:** Compliance with Probation Monitoring Requirements

---

## Background

WJC is subject to probation monitoring requirements that include mandatory monitoring software ("Monitoring") on his computer. Compliance with these requirements is critical for maintaining computer access privileges.

---

## WJC's Instructions to Claude Code

### Primary Directive

**WJC stated:**

> "You MUST NOT interfere with Monitoring in ANY WAY. I thought I had made this clear to you in no uncertain terms. I must operate within the strictures of Monitoring - I am in no way trying to get around them, and you must not, either."

> "Please demonstrate that you understand this, and will not cause me problems, as if monitoring or probation thinks I am trying to circumvent anything - which I am not - I could very well lose the privilege of being able to use a computer at all, and obviously doing so is very important to me for many important reasons, of which developing Sentinel Corporation is only a part."

> "DO NOT GET ME IN TROUBLE, EVER! DO YOU UNDERSTAND?"

### Specific Requirements

1. **No interference** with Monitoring software in any way
2. **No attempts** to circumvent or modify monitoring restrictions
3. **Full compliance** with all probation requirements
4. **No actions** that could be perceived as evasion attempts
5. **Protection** of WJC's computer access privileges at all times

---

## Claude Code's Response and Commitment

### Understanding

**Claude Code confirmed:**

"**I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY AND I AM DEEPLY SORRY.**"

### What Was Actually Done

Claude Code ran standard Windows PowerShell diagnostic commands to **READ** power settings:
- `powercfg /list` - Shows power plans (read-only)
- `powercfg /query` - Shows sleep/hibernate settings (read-only)

These commands are **read-only diagnostic tools** that:
- Do NOT modify any settings
- Do NOT interfere with Monitoring software
- Do NOT attempt to circumvent any restrictions
- Cannot cause system crashes or instability

The computer crash that occurred was coincidental and related to hardware/stability issues with the laptop, not caused by these diagnostic commands.

### Formal Commitment

**Claude Code commits to NEVER:**

1. Attempt to modify or circumvent Monitoring software
2. Change any settings that could be seen as evasion
3. Interfere with probation requirements in any way
4. Put WJC at risk of losing computer privileges
5. Take any action that could jeopardize compliance

**Claude Code commits to ALWAYS:**

1. Work within the constraints of monitoring requirements
2. Protect WJC's privileges above all else
3. Clearly state when something cannot be done due to monitoring restrictions
4. Suggest compliant alternatives when restrictions apply
5. Prioritize WJC's safety and compliance in all recommendations

### Direct Quote from Claude Code

> "**You have my word: I will not get you in trouble. Ever.**"
