# Sentinel Trading Bot - Status Report
**Date**: 2025-10-27 (Week 3, Session 2)
**Prepared by**: Claude Code (after session context restoration)

---

## Executive Summary

### üî¥ CRITICAL: DO NOT GO LIVE TOMORROW

**Recommendation**: Complete comprehensive testing before any live deployment (even paper trading)

**Key Reasons**:
1. **Zero testing performed** - All Week 3 features untested in workflow context
2. **PDT compliance uncertain** - No explicit day trade counting logic found in codebase
3. **Critical bugs just fixed** - Need to validate fixes actually work
4. **New features never run** - SELL execution, Perplexity integration, BUY filtering all untested

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Paper trading account can still be suspended 90 days for PDT violations

**Next Steps**: Follow [TESTING_PLAN.md](TESTING_PLAN.md) before considering live deployment

---

## Critical Bug Fixes (Today's Session)

### Bug #1: Conviction Clamping (CRITICAL)
**File**: `sentinel/tier3_conviction_analysis.py:444`

**Problem**: Tier 3 conviction scores clamped to 1-10 instead of 1-100
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
conviction = max(1, min(10, int(conviction)))  # ‚ùå Lost 90% of range!

# AFTER (FIXED):
conviction = max(1, min(100, int(conviction)))  # ‚úÖ Full 1-100 range
```

**Impact**: Lost 90% of scoring granularity. System couldn't distinguish between conviction 95 (exceptional) and conviction 50 (neutral).

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed in code, ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT validated with real test

---

### Bug #2: Conviction Weighting Formula (CRITICAL)
**File**: `sentinel/order_generator.py:295`

**Problem**: Normalization divided by 10.0 instead of 100.0
```python
# BEFORE (BROKEN):
normalized = conviction / 10.0  # ‚ùå All scores ‚â•10 become 1.0!

# AFTER (FIXED):
normalized = conviction / 100.0  # ‚úÖ Proper normalization
```

**Impact**: All conviction scores ‚â•10 got normalized to 1.0, meaning identical position sizing. Completely broke conviction-weighted allocation. A trade with conviction 95 got the SAME position size as conviction 50.

**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed in code, ‚ö†Ô∏è NOT validated with real test

**Combined Impact**: These two bugs together meant the conviction system was completely non-functional. Position sizing was essentially random.

---

## New Features (Week 3)

### Feature #1: Perplexity Real-Time News
**File**: `sentinel/perplexity_news.py` (new)

**Purpose**: Provides GPT-4-Turbo with current news and market events

**Why Critical**: GPT-4-Turbo alone cannot access current information. Missing earnings beats, analyst upgrades, breaking news, etc.

**Key Methods**:
- `gather_ticker_news()`: Recent news for specific stocks (7 days)
- `gather_market_overview()`: Overall market conditions
- `gather_batch_news()`: Efficient batch gathering

**Cost**: ~$0.005 per query (or $20/month unlimited)

**Status**: ‚úÖ Tested manually (NVDA news, market overview both successful)

---

### Feature #2: SELL Signal Execution
**Files**:
- `sentinel/execution_engine.py`: New `submit_conviction_sell()` method
- `database_migrations/004_add_conviction_sells.sql`: New table

**Critical Gap Filled**: System could only BUY. Positions could only exit via stop-loss or manual intervention.

**What It Does**:
- Submits market sell order based on Tier 3 recommendation
- Cancels associated stop-loss order (prevent double-exit)
- Records details in `conviction_sells` table
- Returns order ID and success status

**Integration**: Used in workflow Step 6A (SELL signals execute BEFORE BUY signals)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è UNTESTED - Never run in live workflow

---

### Feature #3: BUY Conviction Filtering
**Files**: Both workflows (morning + evening)

**Feature**: Added `BUY_CONVICTION_THRESHOLD = 70` (out of 100)

**Rationale**:
- Only execute BUY signals with conviction ‚â•70
- Avoid marginal trades that consume capital without strong edge
- Low-conviction signals logged but not executed

**Important**: SELL signals execute regardless of conviction (safety first)

**Example Behavior**:
```
Input: 18 BUY signals (convictions: 95, 88, 78, 72, 70, 65, 58, 52, ...)
Output: 5 executed (95, 88, 78, 72, 70)
Filtered: 13 signals below threshold
```

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è UNTESTED - Logic looks correct but never run

---

### Feature #4: Real-Time Market Context
**Files**: Both workflows (morning + evening)

**Feature**: Perplexity market overview fetched before Tier 2/3 analysis

**Replaces**: Hardcoded placeholder "Market conditions vary - see detailed analysis"

**What It Provides**:
- Real-time market sentiment (bullish/bearish/mixed)
- Economic data releases, Fed commentary
- Sector rotation and leadership
- Geopolitical events, volatility trends

**Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to generic context if Perplexity fails

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è UNTESTED in workflow (Perplexity itself tested, integration untested)

---

### Feature #5: Morning Workflow
**File**: `sentinel_morning_workflow.py` (new)

**Purpose**: Full workflow for standard 9 AM PT / Noon ET execution

**Includes All Week 3 Features**:
- ‚úÖ BUY conviction filtering (70/100)
- ‚úÖ Real-time market context (Perplexity)
- ‚úÖ SELL-then-BUY sequencing
- ‚úÖ Conviction-weighted sizing (1-100)

**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è UNTESTED - Complete dry-run required

---

## Critical Gap: PDT Compliance

### üî¥ CRITICAL FINDING: No PDT Logic Found

**Search Results**: Searched codebase for:
- "day trade" / "day_trade"
- "pdt" / "PDT"
- "pattern day" / "pattern_day"

**Result**: ZERO matches found in `sentinel/` directory

**What This Means**:
1. System may be submitting orders without checking day trade count
2. Could easily trigger 4+ day trades in 5-day window
3. Paper trading account would be suspended for 90 days
4. Real account would be restricted from day trading

**PDT Rules Refresher**:
- Accounts <$25K limited to 3 day trades per 5 business days
- Day trade = buy‚Üísell or sell‚Üíbuy of same stock on same day
- 4th violation = 90-day suspension
- Paper trading accounts ARE subject to these rules

**Action Required**: MUST verify PDT counting exists before going live

**Possible Locations** (not yet checked):
- Alpaca API may handle this automatically (check docs)
- Logic may be in config or external module
- May be planned but not yet implemented

**Testing Required**:
1. Search entire codebase (not just `sentinel/`)
2. Check Alpaca Python library docs for built-in PDT protection
3. If missing, implement before live deployment

---

## Risk Assessment

### CRITICAL Risks (Must Address Before Live)
1. **No PDT protection found** - Could trigger account suspension
2. **Conviction bugs untested** - Position sizing may still be broken
3. **SELL execution untested** - Cash sequencing could fail
4. **Zero workflow testing** - Unknown crashes or edge cases

### HIGH Risks (Should Address Before Live)
1. **BUY filtering untested** - May filter all signals (too aggressive threshold)
2. **Market context fallback untested** - Could crash if Perplexity fails
3. **API rate limits unknown** - Could exhaust OpenAI/Perplexity quotas

### MEDIUM Risks (Can Monitor After Launch)
1. **Stock universe hardcoded** - Limited to 40 tickers
2. **Analytics placeholders** - Win rate, avg P&L showing mock values
3. **Order size limits unclear** - Could oversized positions theoretically

### LOW Risks (Cosmetic)
1. **Log file organization** - Could improve logging clarity
2. **Error message formatting** - Minor UX improvements possible

## Go-Live Decision Framework

### ‚úÖ Safe to Go Live (Paper Trading)
Requirements:
- [ ] All critical bugs tested and validated
- [ ] Full workflow dry-run successful (no crashes)
- [ ] PDT compliance verified
- [ ] BUY filtering tested (doesn't filter everything)
- [ ] SELL-then-BUY tested (no cash constraint errors)
- [ ] Edge cases handled gracefully (API failures, empty lists, etc.)
- [ ] Manual log review shows reasonable behavior
- [ ] Confidence level: HIGH

**Earliest Possible Date**: After 4-6 hours of testing

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Proceed with Extreme Caution
Conditions:
- Most tests pass but some uncertainty remains
- PDT compliance exists but not thoroughly tested
- Minor bugs found but not critical
- Start with TINY position sizes (1% of capital max)
- Monitor EVERY trade manually for first week

**Confidence Level**: MEDIUM

### üõë DO NOT GO LIVE
Red flags:
- Any component test fails
- PDT compliance missing or broken
- Cash constraint violations observed
- Frequent crashes or errors
- Conviction weighting still broken
- You feel uncertain or rushed

**Current Status**: üõë DO NOT GO LIVE (insufficient testing)

---

## Recommendation for Tomorrow Morning

### Option A: Continue Development (Recommended)
**Timeline**: Tomorrow 9am-1pm
1. **9:00-10:00**: Run component tests (Perplexity, conviction weighting, database)
2. **10:00-11:30**: Run full morning workflow dry-run (no order submission)
3. **11:30-12:30**: Search for and verify PDT compliance logic
4. **12:30-1:00**: Manual log review and edge case testing

**Outcome**: Decision point at 1pm - go live tomorrow afternoon or continue testing

### Option B: Aggressive Timeline (Not Recommended)
**Timeline**: Tomorrow morning
1. **9:00-9:30**: Quick component tests
2. **9:30-10:30**: Single workflow dry-run
3. **10:30-11:00**: Go live with paper trading (tiny sizes)

**Risk**: High - insufficient testing for complex system

### Option C: Conservative Timeline (Safest)
**Timeline**: Rest of week
- **Monday**: Component tests + dry-runs
- **Tuesday**: PDT compliance + edge cases
- **Wednesday**: More dry-runs, log review
- **Thursday**: Go live (paper trading, small sizes)
- **Friday**: Monitor and adjust

**Risk**: Low - thorough validation before live

## What You Should Do Tonight (Before Bed)

Since it's already 9pm and you've been working hard:

### Quick Wins (30 minutes)
1. **Read [TESTING_PLAN.md](TESTING_PLAN.md)** - Understand what testing is needed
2. **Read [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)** - See what got fixed today
3. **Decide on timeline** - Option A, B, or C above?
4. **Set realistic expectations** - No shame in taking extra time for testing

### Optional (If You Have Energy)
5. **Run Perplexity test** - Quick validation it still works:
   ```bash
   python sentinel/perplexity_news.py
   ```
6. **Test conviction weighting** - 5-minute manual test (see [TESTING_PLAN.md](TESTING_PLAN.md) section 1.2)

### Don't Do Tonight
- ‚ùå Don't try to complete all testing (you're tired)
- ‚ùå Don't go live (you'll regret rushing)
- ‚ùå Don't modify code (you've done enough for today)

## Key Takeaways

### What Went Well Today ‚úÖ
1. **All code safely committed to git** - Your work is backed up
2. **Critical bugs identified and fixed** - Conviction system should work now
3. **Documentation created** - CHANGELOG + test plan
4. **Comprehensive review completed** - We know what's working and what's not

### What Needs Attention ‚ö†Ô∏è
1. **PDT compliance uncertain** - Must verify before live
2. **Zero testing completed** - Need 4-6 hours of testing
3. **Conviction fixes not validated** - Must test with real scores

### What You've Accomplished (Bigger Picture) üéâ
**In Less Than 1 Month**:
- Built a three-tier AI trading system
- Integrated 3 different AI APIs (Perplexity, GPT-4, Claude for dev)
- Created database infrastructure
- Implemented conviction-weighted allocation
- Added real-time news integration
- Built SELL execution infrastructure
- Fixed critical bugs proactively

**That's legitimately impressive.** Most people take 3-6 months to build something this sophisticated.

### The Right Way Forward üéØ
**Quality over speed.** You're building a system that will:
- Handle real money (eventually)
- Make dozens of trades per week
- Run unsupervised

Taking an extra day for testing is 100% worth avoiding:
- 90-day PDT suspension
- Costly order errors
- Capital loss from bugs
- Stress from unexpected behavior

**You're close to the finish line. Don't trip right before crossing it.**

## Questions for You

Before you decide on tomorrow's plan:

1. **How confident do you feel** about the system after reading this report?
   - Very confident (let's test and go live)
   - Somewhat confident (let's test thoroughly first)
   - Not confident (let's keep developing)

2. **What's your risk tolerance?**
   - Aggressive (quick testing, go live fast)
   - Moderate (thorough testing, go live when ready)
   - Conservative (extensive testing, multiple dry-runs)

3. **What's your biggest concern?**
   - PDT violations
   - Conviction bugs still broken
   - SELL execution failing
   - Cash constraint errors
   - Something else?

4. **Do you want to work with Claude-4.5-Sonnet** for additional perspective?
   - Yes, get a second opinion before testing
   - Yes, but after my testing
   - No, I'm comfortable proceeding

## Next Session Recommendations

When we meet again (tomorrow or later):

### Priority 1: PDT Compliance Search
```bash
# Search entire codebase (not just sentinel/)
grep -r "day.trade" . --ignore-case | grep -v ".git" | grep -v "node_modules"
grep -r "pdt" . --ignore-case | grep -v ".git"

# Check if Alpaca library handles PDT automatically
python -c "import alpaca_trade_api as tradeapi; help(tradeapi.REST.get_account)"
```

### Priority 2: Database Migration
Make sure `conviction_sells` table exists:
```bash
sqlite3 sentinel.db < database_migrations/004_add_conviction_sells.sql
sqlite3 sentinel.db ".schema conviction_sells"
```

### Priority 3: Component Tests
Follow [TESTING_PLAN.md](TESTING_PLAN.md) Test Suite 1:
1. Perplexity integration (5 min)
2. Conviction weighting (10 min)
3. Database operations (5 min)

### Priority 4: Integration Dry-Run
Follow [TESTING_PLAN.md](TESTING_PLAN.md) Test Suite 2:
1. Modify workflow to skip order submission
2. Run full morning workflow
3. Review logs for errors
4. Validate behavior makes sense
