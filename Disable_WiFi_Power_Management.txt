DISABLE WI-FI POWER MANAGEMENT - MANUAL INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

Purpose: Prevent Windows from turning off Wi-Fi adapter to save power
Safe: YES - Keeps Wi-Fi always on (better for monitoring software)
Date: November 7, 2025

================================================================================
WHY THIS HELPS
================================================================================

Problem: Windows may turn off your Wi-Fi adapter to save power, causing:
  - Internet connection to drop
  - Monitoring software to lose connectivity
  - Need to reboot to restore connection

Solution: Disable power management so Wi-Fi stays on 24/7

This is SAFE for monitoring:
  - Wi-Fi will NEVER sleep
  - Monitoring stays connected continuously
  - Standard setting used by servers and business laptops

================================================================================
STEP-BY-STEP INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

1. Press Windows key + X
2. Click "Device Manager"

3. In Device Manager:
   - Scroll down and expand "Network adapters"
   - Find: "Realtek 8821CE Wireless LAN 802.11ac PCI-E NIC"
   - RIGHT-CLICK on it
   - Select "Properties"

4. In the Properties window:
   - Click the "Power Management" tab

5. Power Management settings:
   - UNCHECK the box: "Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power"
   - Click "OK"

6. DONE! You should see this message or the window will just close.

================================================================================
VERIFICATION
================================================================================

To verify the setting was applied:

1. Go back to Device Manager
2. Right-click the Realtek adapter again
3. Properties → Power Management tab
4. The checkbox should now be UNCHECKED

================================================================================
WHAT THIS DOES
================================================================================

BEFORE: Windows can turn off Wi-Fi when idle (causes connectivity loss)
AFTER:  Wi-Fi stays on 24/7 (reliable connectivity for all software)

Result:
  - No more Wi-Fi sleep
  - Monitoring software stays connected
  - Fewer unexpected internet disconnections
  - Trade-off: Slightly higher battery usage (laptop is usually plugged in)

================================================================================
TROUBLESHOOTING
================================================================================

If you don't see a "Power Management" tab:
  - This is okay, it means the driver doesn't support power management
  - Or it's already disabled at the system level
  - Move on to the next fix (TCP port range)

If the setting keeps reverting:
  - Windows Update may be overwriting it
  - Re-apply after each major Windows update
  - Or disable automatic driver updates for this device

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

After completing this:
1. Run Fix_Network_Settings.bat (as Administrator)
2. Reboot your computer
3. Test for 24 hours to see if connectivity improves
